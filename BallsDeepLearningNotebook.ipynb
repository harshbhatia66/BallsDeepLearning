    "# Introduction to the Modeling Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we delve into the exciting world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to tackle a compelling challenge: developing a chatbot that not only engages in contextually relevant conversations but also emulates the unique conversational styles of characters from the popular TV show \"Rick and Morty\". We chose to work with the DialoGPT model from Microsoft - a variant of the GPT-2 model, that is fine-tuned specifically for dialogues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project involves distinct challenges, each representing a key stage in the development of our chatbot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**: Our first task was to obtain and clean a dataset with enough depth and richness to effectively train our model. This required sourcing and preprocessing dialogues from the TV show.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Character Styles**: Each character in \"Rick and Morty\" boasts a unique conversational style, peppered with their own idiosyncrasies. The complexity of capturing the nuances of their dialogue, including humor, colloquialisms, and catchphrases, represented a significant challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text Generation**: Beyond generating relevant responses, our model needed to convincingly replicate the distinct conversational style of the character in question. The GPT-2, or more precisely, its DialogPT variant was our tool of choice, a finetuned model in generating conversational responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Our final hurdle lay in evaluating our model's performance. Apart from traditional accuracy metrics, we had to assess whether the generated text genuinely encapsulated the character's style. Establishing evaluation metrics represented a unique and interesting problem in itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of Our Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary aim of our project is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to develop an interactive and unique artificial personality. Our focus is not only to ensure contextually relevant conversations but also to emulate the distinctive conversational styles of characters from the TV show \"Rick and Morty\". By utilizing the DialoGPT model, a fine-tuned variant of the GPT-2 model specialized for dialogues, we seek to craft a chatbot that engages users in fun interactions, bringing the personas of \"Rick and Morty\" into our NLP model. Through this project we aim to expand our knowledge of conversational AI models and testing the boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending NLP-Powered Chatbot to Real Business Solutions and Beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of our NLP-powered chatbot could potentially extend beyond just creating a fun character from one popular show \"Rick and Morty\". With a successful Artifical Persona we can create unique and interactive user experiences on various platforms, presenting exciting opportunities for businesses and content creators.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Website with Cool Characters:** We could create a business that can leverage our NLP Artifical Persona Chatbot to design engaging websites featuring interactive and entertaining characters. These characters could be original creations or inspired by popular media franchises. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactive YouTubers:** Content creators, especially YouTubers, can use our NLP-powered Artifical Persona to bring their personas to life in a whole new way. Imagine a YouTube channel where the creator's virtual character interacts with viewers in real-time, responding to comments and engaging in witty banter. If the Artifical Persona is indistinguishable from the real person this personalized and interactive experience could foster a stronger sense of connection between the content creator and their audience, enhancing viewer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customizable Chatbots for Customer Support:** Beyond entertainment, our chatbot technology can serve as a valuable tool for businesses to streamline customer support services. Companies can create customized chatbots with distinct personalities that align with their brand identity. These chatbots can efficiently handle customer inquiries, provide helpful information, and resolve issues, all while maintaining a friendly and engaging conversational style.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Educational Applications:** In the realm of education, our NLP-powered chatbot can be utilized to create interactive and adaptive learning experiences. Students can engage with virtual characters that act as intelligent tutors, providing personalized explanations, quizzes, and feedback based on individual learning preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Virtual Influencers:** As the world of social media continues to evolve, virtual influencers have gained popularity. Our chatbot technology can enable the creation of virtual influencers with unique personalities, who can interact with followers on social media platforms. These virtual influencers can promote products, share content, and engage in conversations with users, offering a fresh approach to influencer marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential applications of our NLP-powered Artifical Persona chatbot are vast and diverse. From enhancing user experiences on websites to transforming the way content creators interact with their audience, and from enhancing customer support to improving education and influencer marketing, the possibilities are limitless. Through this project, we are exploring the capabilities of NLPs and how a successful model could integrate with todays world.\n",

    "## Choice of Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we decided to utilize Microsoft's DialoGPT model. As a variation of the GPT-2 model fine-tuned explicitly for generating conversational responses, DialoGPT seemed well-suited for our task of creating a chatbot that mirrors the dialogue style in the \"Rick and Morty\" show. This model selection was also backed by the promising results demonstrated by DialoGPT in generating contextually relevant and human-like conversational responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), multiple models could have been considered. For instance, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) networks could have been potential choices. However, these recurrent neural network-based models often struggle with long sequences due to the vanishing gradient problem, making them less ideal for dialog systems where the context could be quite lengthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Transformer-based models like GPT-2 overcome this limitation with their attention mechanism. Although the GPT-2 model is already quite powerful, DialoGPT takes it a step further by fine-tuning this base model on a large-scale dialogue dataset. This fine-tuning makes DialoGPT more apt at understanding and generating dialogue, a feature that aligns perfectly with our project goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim was to mimic the humoristic style of \"Rick and Morty\" accurately with a focus on the character of Rick, and also generate contextually coherent and relevant responses in a conversational setting. The DialoGPT model provided a solid foundation for this, allowing us to further train and fine-tune it with our dataset for even better performance.\n",

    "# Data Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we delve into our dataset, which is the cornerstone of any Machine Learning project. We'll explore the data acquisition process, our method for preparing the data for our model, and some challenges associated with the nature of the data and our approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset comes from Kaggle, specifically the [Rick and Morty Scripts dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/rickmorty-scripts) posted by user Andrada Olteanu. This dataset provides lines of dialogue from different characters across various episodes of the show.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **index**: A simple row identifier.\n",
    "- **season no.**: The season in which the dialogue line appears.\n",
    "- **episode no.**: The episode in which the dialogue line appears.\n",
    "- **episode name**: The name of the episode.\n",
    "- **name**: The character who speaks the line.\n",
    "- **line**: The line of dialogue itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the first few lines for context:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "index\tseason no.\tepisode no.\tepisode name\tname\tline\n",
    "0\t1\t1\tPilot\tRick\tMorty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.\n",
    "1\t1\t1\tPilot\tMorty\tWhat, Rick? What’s going on?\n",
    "2\t1\t1\tPilot\tRick\tI got a surprise for you, Morty.\n",
    "```\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our major tasks in data preparation is formatting this dataset for training our model, which requires a context-response structure. Each response will have the `n` previous responses as its context. We decided that `n = 7`, meaning each response has the seven preceding lines of dialogue as its context. The reason for this decision is that, in most conversations, the last 7 exchanges provide a sufficient context for understanding the current response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where you might choose to include a code snippet demonstrating how you generate the context for each line. (This is merely a suggestion, depending on your workflow and your professor's expectations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our dataset is structured appropriately, we divide it into training and test subsets. This split allows us to train our model on one set of data (training) and evaluate its performance on a separate set (test) that it has not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we convert our dataset into a format suitable for our DialogPT model. This requires concatenating the responses into a single string for each row, separated by a special 'end of string' token. This token enables the model to identify the end of each response in a string.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Data**: Our dataset consists of only about 2,500 lines of dialogue. This is quite a small dataset for a machine learning project. Because the GPT-2 model was initially trained on a much larger dataset, fine-tuning it on our smaller dataset may lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Character Diversity**: Each line in the dataset can come from a different character, adding another level of complexity to the task. The model needs to learn not only the response to a given line but also which character is likely to say that response. Given the limited size of our dataset, this could affect the model's ability to accurately capture each character's style.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Length**: The choice of using seven previous responses as context is somewhat arbitrary and could affect the model's performance. If the context is too short, the model may not have enough information to generate an appropriate response. On the other hand, if the context is too long, the model may become too complex and harder to train.\n",

    "The input data to GPT-2 (and in our case, the DialogPT variant we're using) is structured as a 2D tensor, where the first dimension represents individual instances (in our case, dialogues) and the second dimension represents the tokenized words within each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because, at its core, GPT-2 is a transformer model, which was designed to handle sequence data, and text data is fundamentally a sequence of words or tokens. By representing our text data as a 2D tensor, we can maintain the sequence nature of our data while enabling the model to process multiple instances simultaneously for efficient batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the shape of our input data, consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inputs = [[\"I\", \"am\", \"GPT-2\"], [\"Hello\", \"world\"]]\n",
    "```\n",

    "This list of lists represents two sentences, each of which is a sequence of words. After tokenization and numerical encoding, our data might look something like this:\n",

    "inputs = [[9, 84, 30522], [15496, 2327]]\n",
    "```\n",

    "However, because tensor operations require our data to be in a regular shape (i.e., each instance must have the same length), we need to pad our data to account for sentences of different lengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inputs = [[9, 84, 30522, 0], [15496, 2327, 0, 0]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our input data is a 2D tensor of shape (2, 4). The first dimension, of length 2, represents our two sentences, and the second dimension, of length 4, represents the words within each sentence. The '0' values are padding tokens that we've added to make each sentence the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, GPT-2 uses this 2D tensor as input into its self-attention mechanism. In a nutshell, self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of each word within a sentence when predicting the next word. The weights are learned during training and depend on the context provided by the other words in the sentence. This is how GPT-2 is able to generate contextually relevant responses.\n",

    "# DialoGPT - A GPT-2 Variant Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2) model, developed by OpenAI, is a large-scale transformer-based language model. It builds upon the architecture of the original GPT model, with improvements in the model size, training data, and parameters. The GPT-2 model is designed to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a given sequence of words. This makes it particularly suitable for tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and more. In the context of our assignment, the GPT-2 architecture forms the basis for the DialoGPT model, which we use to create a chatbot that mimics the character Rick from Rick and Morty.\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/dialogpt.png\" alt=\"dialogpt\" height=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer model, introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al., is the backbone of the GPT-2 model. The Transformer model is based on a self-attention mechanism and does away with recurrence and convolutions entirely. This architecture allows the model to process input sequences in parallel, rather than sequentially, leading to significant improvements in training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT-2 model uses a modified version of the Transformer, which only includes the decoder part of the original Transformer model. The decoder consists of a stack of identical layers, each with two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. A residual connection is employed around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our chatbot application, the Transformer architecture allows the model to generate responses in a conversational context, considering the entire context of the conversation rather than just the immediate previous response.\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/gpt2_architecture.png\" alt=\"gpt_architecture\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "## Self-Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-attention mechanism, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a key component of the Transformer architecture. It allows the model to weigh the importance of words in an input sequence when generating an output sequence. In other words, it helps the model to decide where to \"pay attention\" when generating text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our chatbot, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to generate responses that are contextually relevant and coherent. For example, if a user asks the chatbot a question about a specific episode of Rick and Morty, the self-attention mechanism helps the model to focus on the relevant parts of the conversation history when generating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/self_attention.webp\" alt=\"self_attention\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional encoding is used in the Transformer model to give the model some information about the relative positions of the words in the input sequence. Since the Transformer model doesn't have any recurrence or convolutions, it doesn't have any inherent sense of position or order of the words. Positional encoding solves this problem by adding a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that allows the model to determine the position of each word in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our chatbot, positional encoding helps the model to generate responses that make sense in the context of the conversation. For example, if a user asks a follow-up question, the model can use the positional encoding to understand that the follow-up question is related to the previous question, and generate a response accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/positional_encoding.png\" alt=\"positional_encoding\" height=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layer Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer normalization is a technique used in the GPT-2 model to stabilize the neural network's learning process. It normalizes the inputs across the features instead of normalizing the features across the batch as in batch normalization. In other words, for each feature computed, layer normalization computes the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our chatbot, layer normalization helps to stabilize the learning process and improve the model's performance. It ensures that the scale of the features does not change drastically, making the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. This is particularly important for a chatbot application, where the model needs to handle a wide variety of inputs and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/layer_norm.png\" alt=\"layer_norm\" height=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer of the GPT-2 model contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation function in between. While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward networks in the GPT-2 model serve to increase the representational power of the model. They allow the model to learn more complex patterns in the data, which is crucial for a chatbot application. For example, the model needs to understand complex conversational patterns, detect sarcasm or humor, and generate responses that are not only contextually relevant but also in line with the character's personality (in this case, Rick from Rick and Morty).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/feed_forward.png\" alt=\"feed_forward\" height=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Size and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT-2 model comes in several sizes, ranging from \"small\" (117 million parameters) to \"extra large\" (1.5 billion parameters). The size of the model (i.e., the number of parameters) is a key factor that determines the model's capacity to learn from data. A larger model can learn more complex patterns in the data, but it also requires more computational resources to train and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our chatbot, we need to balance the model size with the available computational resources and the complexity of the task. For example, if we want the chatbot to generate highly creative and nuanced responses that closely mimic the character Rick, we might opt for a larger model.

    "The GPT-2 model, like many other language models, uses a loss function to measure the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes. This loss function is crucial for training the model, as it provides a metric that the model can aim to minimize through gradient descent.\n",

    "In the case of GPT-2, the loss function used is the Cross-Entropy Loss. This is a common choice for classification problems, including language modeling, which can be thought of as the task of predicting the next word in a sequence (a form of classification).\n",

    "### Cross-Entropy Loss\n",

    "\n",
    "The model outputs a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for the next word in a sequence. The Cross-Entropy Loss is then calculated between this predicted distribution and the actual outcome (which is a one-hot encoded vector representing the actual next word).\n",

    "# DialoGPT and its Adaptation from GPT-2\n",
    "\n",
    "DialoGPT is a variant of the GPT-2 model, specifically fine-tuned for conversational responses. It was trained on a large dataset of internet-based conversations, allowing it to generate human-like conversational responses. This makes DialoGPT particularly suitable for chatbot applications, such as our Rick and Morty character chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences and Similarities with GPT-2\n",
    "\n",
    "While DialoGPT and GPT-2 share the same underlying Transformer architecture, there are some key differences between the two models, mainly due to the fine-tuning process used to train DialoGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture**: Both GPT-2 and DialoGPT are based on the Transformer architecture, which includes components like self-attention mechanism, positional encoding, layer normalization, and feed-forward networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Method**: Both models are trained using a variant of the Transformer's decoder, with masked self-attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generative Models**: Both GPT-2 and DialoGPT are generative models, meaning they generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Function**: Another similarity between GPT-2 and DialoGPT is the loss function used during training. Both models use the cross-entropy loss function, a common choice for training language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cross-entropy loss measures the dissimilarity between the model's predictions and the actual data. In the context of language models like GPT-2 and DialoGPT, the model's prediction is the probability distribution of the next word in the sequence, and the actual data is the true next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The cross-entropy loss for a single prediction can be calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    H(p, q) = - Σ p(x) log(q(x))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "    - `p` is the true probability distribution (in this case, a one-hot encoded vector of the true next word)\n",
    "    - `q` is the predicted probability distribution (the model's output)\n",
    "    - `Σ` denotes the sum over all classes (words in the vocabulary)\n",
    "    - `log` is the natural logarithm\n",
    "\n",
    "    The goal during training is to minimize this loss, i.e., to make the model's predictions as close as possible to the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the context of our chatbot, minimizing the cross-entropy loss means that the model is effectively learning to predict the next word in a dialogue, given the previous words. This allows the model to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, mimicking the character Rick from Rick and Morty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Data**: While GPT-2 is trained on a diverse range of internet text, DialoGPT is specifically fine-tuned on a dataset of internet dialogues. This allows DialoGPT to generate more conversational and contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: DialoGPT uses a byte-level BPE tokenizer, which allows it to handle a wider range of input text compared to GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fine-Tuning**: DialoGPT is fine-tuned for dialogue generation tasks, which makes it more suitable for chatbot applications compared to GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our chatbot, the fine-tuning process allows DialoGPT to generate responses that are more conversational and contextually appropriate.

    "### Comparison of DialoGPT Small and Large\n",
    "\n",
    "DialoGPT comes in different sizes, with the \"small\" and \"large\" variants being two of them. The primary difference between these variants lies in their capacity, which is determined by the number of parameters they have. The \"large\" variant has more parameters than the \"small\" one, which generally allows it to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effect on Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The increased capacity of the DialoGPT large model can lead to improved performance in generating text that mimics the character Rick Sanchez. It can potentially capture more nuanced aspects of Rick's personality and provide more contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the larger model also requires more computational resources to train and use, which can be a limiting factor depending on the available hardware. Additionally, larger models can sometimes overfit to the training data, especially if the dataset is small. This means that they might perform exceptionally well on the training data but struggle to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the DialoGPT small model, while less capable than the large model, is more computationally efficient. It can be trained and used on less powerful hardware, making it a more accessible option. However, its performance might not be as good as the large model, especially on complex tasks like mimicking a specific character's personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our Rick Sanchez chatbot, choosing between the small and large DialoGPT models involves a trade-off between performance and computational efficiency. The best choice would depend on the specific requirements of the project, including the available hardware, the size of the training data, and the desired level of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the majority of our training we confirmed that DialoGPT-small is indeed most appropriate for our project considering the performance in terms of robustness in capturing conversational nuances, and size of the model because of the limited time/computing resources. \n",

    "The untrained DialoGPT model is a powerful language model capable of generating human-like text. However, without fine-tuning, it lacks the specific personality traits and knowledge of the character Rick Sanchez. Let's evaluate its performance based on the given dialogues:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's responses are generally coherent in the sense that they form grammatically correct and complete sentences. However, they lack coherence in the context of the conversation. For example, the model's response \"I am the one who knocks\" to the question \"Who are you?\" is a coherent sentence, but it doesn't make sense in the context of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's responses are not always relevant to the questions asked. For instance, when asked \"Do you know Morty?\", the model responds with \"I do not.\" This is not relevant since Rick Sanchez, the character the model is supposed to mimic, is Morty's grandfather and they share a close relationship in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Personality\n",

    "The model is robust in the sense that it can generate a response to any input. However, the quality and relevance of the responses can vary significantly, as seen in the dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context Awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "The model lacks context awareness. For example, it doesn't recognize the relationship between Rick and Morty, and it doesn't provide a thoughtful response to the question about the possibility of aliens in an infinite universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The untrained DialoGPT model, while solid, does not effectively simulate the personality of Rick Sanchez. It lacks context awareness, doesn't always provide relevant responses, and doesn't exhibit Rick's distinctive personality traits. This highlights the importance of fine-tuning the model on specific dialogues from the Rick and Morty series to create a more accurate and engaging Rick Sanchez chatbot. Fine-tuning should help the model learn the nuances of Rick's personality and improve its performance in all the evaluated areas."

    "### Limitations and Influence of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "One notable issue is the occasional loss of coherence, particularly in maintaining the persona of Rick Sanchez consistently throughout the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the last line of the dialogue, the model says, \"Oh, man, Rick. I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.\" This response is problematic because the model, which is supposed to be simulating Rick, refers to Rick in the third person, indicating a loss of persona coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue could be influenced by the diversity of dialogues in the training dataset. If the dataset contains dialogues from multiple characters, the model might learn to switch between different personas. While this could be beneficial in a multi-character chatbot, it's not desirable in our case, where the model is supposed to consistently simulate a single character, Rick Sanchez.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this issue, we could refine the dataset to include only dialogues where Rick is speaking. This would help the model learn to maintain Rick's persona more consistently. Additionally, we could experiment with techniques like persona conditioning, where additional information about the persona is provided to the model to help it maintain the persona more effectively.\n"

    "# Fine-Tuning Parameters in DialoGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the choice of parameters can significantly impact the performance of a model. During our experiments with the DialoGPT model, we played around with various parameters to optimize the model's performance. Here are some of the key parameters we experimented with and the impact they had on the model's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Size of Context Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The context size, or the amount of previous dialogue the model considers when generating a response, is a crucial parameter. A larger context size allows the model to consider more of the conversation history, which can lead to more relevant and coherent responses. However, it also increases the computational complexity of the model, leading to longer training times. It's also worth noting that while a larger context size can improve performance, it can also lead to overfitting if the model starts to memorize specific sequences from the training data instead of learning general patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/para1.png\" alt=\"p1\" height=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of training epochs, or complete passes through the entire training dataset, is another important parameter. Training for more epochs allows the model to learn more from the data, which can lead to improved performance. However, there's a risk of overfitting if the model is trained for too many epochs, as it might start to memorize the training data instead of learning to generalize from it. It's also worth noting that the optimal number of epochs can depend on various factors, including the size and complexity of the dataset and the capacity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/para2.png\" alt=\"p2\" height=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate is a critical hyperparameter that controls how much the model's weights are updated in response to the estimated error each time the weights are updated. A smaller learning rate requires more training epochs as the changes made to the weights each update are smaller. In contrast, a larger learning rate may allow the model to learn faster, but it can also lead to unstable training and poor performance. It's often beneficial to experiment with different learning rates or use techniques like learning rate schedules or adaptive learning rates to find an optimal learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/para3.png\" alt=\"p3\" height=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The block size, or the number of input tokens the model considers at a time, can impact both the computational efficiency and the performance of the model. A smaller block size can lead to faster training, but it might also limit the model's ability to learn longer-term dependencies in the data. On the other hand, a larger block size can improve the model's performance by allowing it to consider more context, but it also increases the computational complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/para4.png\" alt=\"p4\" height=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Large vs Small Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the model, determined by the number of parameters it has, can significantly impact its performance. Larger models have more capacity to learn complex patterns in the data, which can lead to improved performance. However, they also require more computational resources to train and are more prone to overfitting, especially when the amount of training data is limited. On the other hand, smaller models are more computationally efficient and less prone to overfitting, but they might not have enough capacity to learn complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/para5.png\" alt=\"p5\" height=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of optimizer can also impact the model's performance. Different optimizers use different strategies to update the model's weights based on the gradients of the loss function, which can lead to differences in training speed and final performance. However, the impact of the optimizer can also depend on other factors, like the learning rate and the complexity of the model and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, fine-tuning the parameters of the DialoGPT model is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors. The optimal settings can depend on the specific task, the available computational resources, and the characteristics of the training data.\n",

The reader will find that though I may proceed to ask him whether the two notions of reason are the same. For I ask, first, whether such ideas will admit of correction and solution, or do neither. But what I was saying, replied, we shall arrive at the same point of time about these questions; and, if, as has appeared, they are the only two, no one will assert, that reason possesses the authority of that power, and that reason, according to the hypothesis of this, is the only medium between them. For, in an empirical science, the absolute totality of the two conceptions and the former can be proved either by a universal law of the completeness of the latter, or of the former, from without the factious and necessary completeness of the object. The question to be equally apparent contradictions. If there are only one part of the two conceptions of the third in the series of the two principles and not in any given series of ideas, it, of the series must, one and never the other predicates; then I shall not merely assume both, the possibility; and that the totality of the two statements are valid, that there can be at least, that, this proposition must not exist in the one, each conception of the second statements of the series consists of an empirical statements; which I can be contradictory statements, by the four, by reason, I cannot be possible only by the unity, that unity as in contradiction. For, that the unconditioned in this, cannot be one and must be the possibility, is not, the absolute necessity neither must be, must never contradict, therefore, by the unconditioned in this may be as, be, we cannot be the only of the two propositions, contain in the totality of two, be the fourth and not in each, or in the mode, be proved, be also in the two propositions, only one can never one, one, contradict, that if one series has no parts, the complete series. The object is impossible, I shall require, I shall be not in that there must exist in the case the unconditioned the conclusion, that there are the whole, the three only be a necessary, that, of which are two, in relation, although the second only exist either of the conception. The proposition of the principle of the two must be either, can be either. For, in some, I am unable to answer, without contradiction that, are all phenomena; this can be proved, as a contingent and as to be determined only by experience. And, no one must cease to exist, or must be equally impossible. But what a transcendent, is impossible. I can never be denied by experience. The division of conceptions, from the subject, therefore, must not exist in both, and must cease to be impossible; or, as the conception. This division of phenomena are transcendent; I say, I cannot, from pure conceptions, by means of the totality of reason, or, must have, never cease to exist by means only one principle. For I can never be given by means of contradiction. I have, not in no reason; and there are not empirical propositions and not an absolute non-theology. Now the conditions of an impossible series of phenomena as the non-existence. Nor can be in a transcendent propositions, are, transcendental synthetical propositions. A, no absolute totality, must be therefore, cannot be a series of the series of the two distinct principles of a transcendental unity or a conception, and are never without condition of the conditions. A priori. There must cease, which, without means, not to be given in relation to a thing. The world, no conception; and cannot be contingent. But a, of a possible things which is not absolutely beyond, all, and, I cannot be possible. But the contradictory propositions, never cease to be subject to the condition; and, and must be, in general, according to a non-existence, is void of the series; I can only as to be non-existence in the only in existence.

    "The fundamental question of metaphysics is, whether the principle is not merely regulative and its effects may be empirical, or if not synthetical, be judged as natural. The objective method of transcendental ideas is a priori, and of course the conception of any of these ideas from the principles. And when we have given these directions to our understanding, we can infer no but its synthetical principles. In order to prove this, we must first remove the difficulties of the question from the principle of the determination of the empirical conception, that is, to infer it synthetically from the principle of the possibility of the existence of any synthetical proposition. In such cases we have in common with the speculative reason an entire and absolute impossibility. Hence we can no longer assume this conception to be transcendental, and can no longer believe in any other, than for this reason, that it could conceive that such a principle in an abstracted conception, and contingent connexion to any object as that can never would contradict all the existence. But since, that the object must never have a universal use of the understanding of understanding and understanding can never be the conception in any of the object as its object, without any determinate objects of our experience in itself. For the objective reason has no experience. But reason, therefore, the object, I admit it possesses a different ideas of its own priori distinct conceptions, and in the internal conceptions of the possibility of its internal intuition, must be the possibility, without any empirical unity. Now I know only possible experience, its conception of these, the existence is not in general conditions of experience a contingent causes. But, in so far as it no empirical principles of the understanding, the objects of the external intuitions, this universal principles in a possible objects only, the possibility without in accordance with universal laws according to be a transcendental principles. In the existence, a transcendental conceptions of a transcendental reason in its operations of external experience or of the objects, the causality to be, a priori principles of these principles. Now, if it can never a priori and subject of the internal intuition of the internal experience as subject, without which the internal sense can proceed with this, the internal intuition must be, a priori of the conception. A priori and an external intuition a priori in phenomena a priori. For it has a necessary conjoined all phenomena; and I do not establish that a priori a priori to the determination of that self, the universal validity of the possibility of things a priori a priori, by means of the causalitya priori judgments, as a given phenomenon in accordance with which, must be valid for every internal experience without being a purpose, a natural science. Now, in the mode of reason. But in an empirical intuition, all our sensuous object, and the conversely, must have any object, the universal laws according to that the understanding, as we must be of experience. Hence, a priori; and the former, the conjoin the objects without which can not a principle of the possibilitya priori; and in relation of the possibility. In both of possible experience, are impossible. In order we must, in the first principles of naturea mere conceptions, a prioria relation to be transcendental hypotheses of the empirical cognition, all phenomena, be considered as principles which can have no empirical causes of the unity of the existencewhich cannot be independent of our external things according to the series of the existence and to be determinate; these two contradictory principles. Now, if any universal ideas, and of the absolute existence. But that we can be not be thus in the object in a priori. The object of the non- is not internal substances as phenomena, and a priori, in relation to phenomena as independent of no one must precediae, therefore only of a priori, can not in themselves the unconditioned, it must exist as to be given in one of the series of things in the possibilitya priori inasmuch a priori. But the internal purposiveness of the conception of experience. If this can exist in no internal existence according to the nature, without any empirical unity and can never, or, it is in the empirical, it is not a transcendental, in relation to the conception, the possibility according to the series of a pure reason; therefore the conception, are transcendent, in the objectin relation to the object. Thus we may be assured as possible, in itself. The internal, of an object and not as existing by reason, the internal subject.  The only. The principles cannot be deduced priori. For it may not be applied to phenomena, with certain priori in the formal conditions of the possibility. Of the universal principles, the possibility of things a priori, is a priori according to the conditions, in general, are only necessary. The internal experience.\n",

    "Training the GPT-2 model on a dataset of Shakespearean texts resulted in the generation of text that stylistically aligns with Shakespeare's works. However, the experiment also highlighted the challenge of capturing the depth and nuance of Shakespearean narratives. This experiment underscores the complexity of training models on nuanced domains like literature and provides valuable insights for future work in this area.\n"

    "Rick: *As soon as you start talking, I drop the binoculars and hold up my arms. I start waving my arms and yelling.*\n",
    "**Don't be scared!**  *I say to the aliens.*\n",
    "**We're not gonna hurt you!**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated conversation exhibits some interesting characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creativity**: The model continues to generate creative responses, introducing a new narrative about an alien invasion.\n",
    "- **Relevance**: The responses are relevant to the user's inputs, maintaining a consistent narrative throughout the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Character Consistency**: The model still struggles with maintaining the character of Rick Sanchez. Rick's responses do not align with his established persona as a genius scientist with a sarcastic and funny tone. Instead, the model introduces a new narrative about an alien invasion, which is not consistent with Rick's character.\n",
    "- **Coherence**: The conversation lacks coherence in some parts. For example, Rick's actions and responses to the alien invasion do not align with his character's established traits and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learnings\n",
    "The Pygmalion model, with its 6 billion parameters, represents a significant advancement in language model capabilities. It has been trained extensively on a diverse range of data, which allows it to generate creative and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experiment, we used Pygmalion to simulate conversations with the character Rick Sanchez from the \"Rick and Morty\" series. We provided the model with a brief personality description of Rick and let it generate responses based on user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results were intriguing. The model demonstrated a high level of creativity, introducing new narratives and responding to user inputs in a contextually relevant manner. This suggests that the Pygmalion model has a strong potential for generating engaging and dynamic conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model also exhibited some limitations. Despite being provided with a character persona, the model struggled to maintain the specific character traits of Rick Sanchez consistently throughout the conversation. The responses sometimes lacked coherence and did not always align with Rick's established character traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment highlighted the potential of using larger, well-trained models like Pygmalion for character-based conversation generation. However, it also underscored the challenges in maintaining character consistency and coherence, particularly when the model is only provided with a brief character description.\n",

    "# Conclusion and Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we embarked on a journey to create a chatbot that could emulate the personality of Rick Sanchez from the popular TV show \"Rick and Morty\". We utilized the DialoGPT model, a variant of the GPT-2 model, and fine-tuned it on a dataset of dialogues from the show. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fine-tuned model demonstrated a significant improvement in emulating Rick's personality compared to the standard DialoGPT model. It was able to generate responses that were not only coherent and contextually relevant but also captured the unique personality traits of Rick Sanchez. However, we also observed some limitations, such as occasional lapses in coherence and the model's tendency to lose its persona in extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also experimented with different parameter settings in the DialoGPT model, such as the size of the context data, training epochs, learning rate, block size, and optimizer. We found that increasing the size of the context for training and the number of training epochs generally improved the model's performance. However, changing the block size and optimizer did not significantly affect the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the \"Rick and Morty\" dataset, we also experimented with other datasets and models. We trained the GPT-2 model on a dataset of philosophical texts and another of Shakespearean texts. The models generated text that stylistically aligned with the respective domains, demonstrating the versatility of the GPT-2 model. However, capturing the depth and nuance of these domains proved to be a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project demonstrated the potential of transformer-based models like GPT-2 and DialoGPT in generating text that emulates a specific style or personality. However, it also highlighted the challenges in capturing the depth and nuance of complex domains. Future work could focus on improving the model's ability to maintain its persona in extended dialogues and exploring more sophisticated techniques for fine-tuning the model on nuanced domains.\n"
