[speaker] Secondhand embarrassment is a very real phenomenon. It occurs when you... witness something that is so grossly turbo cringe that your body has a fight or flight response and fills you with shame from just having watched it, even though you weren't directly involved in the situation. I think the number one cause of secondhand embarrassment is bad stand-up comedy. So you know, like what's the deal with airline food? Salt shakers, you fill them up and then where does it all go? Like when a stand-up...
[speaker] I feel like most people get embarrassed for the person up there. But today... I got so much secondhand embarrassment, I feel like I got a year's worth of shame in one afternoon. Thanks to the TikTok congressional hearing that happened. This was an absolute mockery of the entire country. It was absolutely foul. It was painful to watch. So I'd like to show you just a few of the clips. The whole thing was about five and a half hours. long and I can't imagine anyone can make it to the end without puking.
[speaker] It's brutal. It has everything you're probably imagining tech illiteracy and horrible questions out the wazoo all wrapped up into one five hour endurance test of the human patience. In a nutshell, there's been a lot of controversy about TikTok and TikTok bans like banning on government phones, which I do agree with. I don't think there's any argument to be made that a fucking government or someone in power. person should have TikTok on their phone just because of potential security risks associated with it.
[speaker] And this has expanded into a lot of other big debates around it. I am not a personal fan of the platform in general, I don't really use it that often. Plus, I'm not a fan of the platform. I think it's been extremely detrimental to the actual mental health and attention span of human beings. Cause now, I don't know if you go on TikTok often, if you go on TikTok and it's someone just talking about something or a clip of something. There is always subway surfers, Rocket League or GTA playing under
[speaker] in order to keep your attention because people need such constant stimulation and jingling keys If there's not like three separate videos of like bars of soap getting cut for satisfying videos or rocket League freestyling while the core video itself is playing they click off that shit is a so pathetic, it's actual brain rot behavior. I am very curious to see in 10 years. If that's going to be the commonplace for everything in the world. Like if movies now are going to be like playing a movie.
[speaker] but then also underneath it another separate movie making sure that your attention is captured like it's so Baffling just how far the attention span of humans is degrading where they can't watch a fucking 30 second video without three other videos also playing to keep their attention. But with all of that being said, I still don't want to see it nationally banned or any shit like that. And the reason's very simple.
[speaker] Because I like a world where people have the freedom to choose what they do with their whole life pretty much. So if you want to download TikTok, you should, even in spite of potential security. risks to your privacy or whatever that should entirely be on the individual's choice. Does the entertainment the platform offer outweigh the potential security risks to your data being sold or whatever? That's up to the person to decide. That's my ideal scenario.
[speaker] where people have the freedom to make their own fucking choices there when it comes to some shit like this. I have made it clear I'm no fan of TikTok. I am also very confident that there is a huge level of like... spyware with TikTok associated with it more than the CEO lets on. but holy shit this congressional hearing or whatever. has done nothing but make the CEO of TikTok look like a patient saint. like an actual Zen master to deal with the
[speaker] unhinged the lunacy and out of touch questions those fucking fossils were throwing his way. It blew my mind. It blew my fucking mind. Her. Oh my god, she's so dumb. She kept asking him questions but instead of letting him answer she just said yes. Yes. Yes. and then she pulled up a random shit post on TikTok like you see this threat. Oh, fuck me. Yeah, so she pulled this up and she's like, look at this! Outrageous! It's not a viral post or anything, by the way.
[different_speaker] video one day ago.
[speaker] Dude, who asked about TikTok using Wi-Fi? I don't remember, but I think they were trying to make a bigger point. And this is really giving a very charitable... A bone. to the person who asked the question, I think. what they were getting at with asking about Wi-Fi. is he was trying to state that If one device is connected to a network, it can access everything on that network, which it can. but he couldn't ask the question because I don't think he really fully understood it.
[speaker] But again, I'm doing a very charitable... service trying to even make some sense out of that awful question. This accomplished nothing except making their CEO look better. fullheartedly believe there is a lot more fishy shit at play on the back end of TikTok. But they did not even get close to the bottom of it, because they couldn't even wrap their head around what an app on your phone is.
[different_speaker] It's tragic. Mr. Zhang Fuping is the editor in chief. He's not. My colleague, Representative Bernard. Just doesn't... I didn't even let him say it or talk. Our general counsel is an American lawyer, founder of Microsoft. Also my colleague. Representative Lada confirmed that your parents can currently can access user data Yes. We have to be more specific. Yes. After Project Texas? No. I'm not asking after Project Texas, I'm asking now.
[different_speaker] Yes. Some user data is public data, Congresswoman. Which means everybody can search for the data. Ugh. the word trarency over a half a dozen times.
[speaker] Uh, doesn't seem to understand that when you ask a question, you should wait for an answer instead of filling your own blanks here. So, her asking about the data that they're accessing. He talks about the public data, which is something every app in the world accesses. Even that computer she's on right there. I bet she's logged in. in on Twitter. That uses all of your fucking data too. I bet she has a Facebook account. That not only accesses all of your data, it sells it too.
[speaker] All of these apps do that. What they needed to get to the bottom of is more in line with like, what is TikTok's... specifically doing with that data and how it relates to like the CCP and shit like that. But instead they're so hung up on like. Public data? You're accessing public profiles? That's creepy. That's something one of the guys said. It's so fucking crazy. And for some reason they don't even let him answer so they get no answers.
[speaker] They get nothing out of this. It is fucking worthless. It is a complete waste of time. They said they were watching children's public profiles, which was creepy. Everything's watching every public profile ever. That's the whole point of being public. It gets scanned in these systems. That's not exclusive to TikTok. Twitter does it. Facebook does it. YouTube does it, everything does it. Literally everything. We threw away our privacy long, long ago. TikTok is just a little more nefarious potentially.
[speaker] with what it uses that data for, at least based on like reports from a year or two ago. Not meant to be informational or useful. It's meant to grandstand for campaigns. It's actually tame compared to everything else. Well, I guess maybe. It's still so stupid though, because this doesn't do anything to further anyone's agen- to hear that everyone that asked him questions today looks like a bumbling fucking buffoon. A genuine moron.
[speaker] Like, I feel like all this does is shake people's confidence in their elected representatives here. They couldn't answer a- or they couldn't ask a good question. Were they like this with Mark Zuckerberg? Yes, yes they were. It was just as bad with Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg sat in the same hot seat as this guy did, and he got bombarded with CHEAT. just as stupid questions. If I remember correctly, one of the Facebook questions was, Do I need internet to connect to Facebook or something like that?
[speaker] We are not getting anything out of this garbage. What do you think their approach should be on this topic? Hand it off to people that understand it. Clearly, this woman doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about. At all. She has no clue what's going on right there. And she clearly doesn't even want to get answers because she's too busy answering herself. So get someone who gets it. have them ask the questions and come up with the questions to begin with. Delegate. This is clearly not her strong suit.
[speaker] She's not even old! That you can't just keep using the excuse of they're all fucking geriatric. She is not old. She is willfully stupid. and still tries to act like an authority on the topic. She pulled up a fucking 400 view shitpost. to try and use it as a point that completely fell flat. and then doesn't even let the guy answer her questions because she's too busy answering herself. Now while she may have come to this hootenanny unprepared and made me ashamed to be a Floridian,
[speaker] She did mention something that I think is important to talk about briefly, which is Project Texas. Project Texas is something TikTok did to appease the US. In a quick nutshell, Project Texas is US user data. being sent to Oracle, which is on American soil as opposed to to going anywhere else. So all of the US user data will now be on American American soil and Oracle kind of oversees the whole thing.
[different_speaker] downloaded on your device and the other doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I believe Congress and DOD should. address any use of tic-tock on military installations as well as any use that depicts US military operations. Mr. Chute, does TikTok access the home Wi-Fi network? Only if the user turns on the wifi. I'm sorry, I may not understand. So far, I have a free talk.
[speaker] Again, this is being very charitable. I think the point he was trying to make is... When it accesses the wifi, it has access to all of your devices that are within that network, which A free device that accesses your wifi does. That is factual. That is true. Which is actually something that happened to Kaya. He downloaded a tor- Oh- A burglar broke in and downloaded a torrent and it came with a virus which infected multiple devices that were on his network.
[speaker] It is known that when you are on a Wi-Fi network, it connects to more than just just the single thing that's connected to it. It's everything there. So I think his point was. Can it access my other devices? Which is why he's talking about like downloading on a device next to me. shit like that. But the way he asked that question is so bafflingly stupid that even the TikTok CEOs like- Fucking obviously, it's gonna access your Wi-Fi if you turn it on. Right? It's just craziness.
[speaker] So have someone who understands what the fuck they're talking about be the one to ask these questions. I think you gave him too much credit. He probably thinks wifi is a radio. Again, it's a very charitable interpretation of what I think he could have been trying to say. I could be way off and giving way too much credit there, I don't know. For the sake of clarity, I actually think that guy's follow-up question kind of hints more at what I was saying.
[speaker] even though it's still poorly asked and his follow-up question is still poorly phrased, I do think with a high level of confidence. The thing he was trying to get at is, is TikTok going to be accessing all kinds of things on my network? Outside of just the one device that I'm using right now to connect to it I think is what he really wanted to get at, but he didn't know how to get to that topic. effectively. So he ended up making a very silly
[speaker] question out of the whole thing, which really sums up the entire hearing just silly questions that didn't do anything at all. They didn't get any answers. They didn't get to the bottom of any real questions. People. have, it was just a genuine fucking circus. Just an absolute clown show. That's really about it. See ya. Right now there is the wackiest legal battle I've ever learned about going on in this sh- There's a secret war between major food brands and the FDA.
[speaker] mainly serial producers like General Mills and Kellogg's. because the FDA is proposing new guidelines on the term healthy. when it relates to things like their cereal. And under these new potential guidelines their serials would have to erase that term from their marketing. And they're not too happy about it. They're wiggling their fingers saying no, no, no. We have a First Amendment right to free speech, which they have been using for...
[speaker] years to effectively lie and mislead their customers into thinking that their cereals aren't good. bad for them. Free speech is a beautiful and sacred wonderful thing that that plays no role in this corporate greed and false advertisement. I think it should be obvious that corporations can't just make shit up and make any claims they want. to just pull random like nonsense claims out of their ass for their products in order to sell it. There needs to be some truth to the claim.
[speaker] Like this is not a free speech issue. This is literally just bad business practice and fucking lying. Alleged lying. I wanna make it clea- Alleged. General Mills and Kellogg's have been fucking shaking their fists and wiggling in anger at this whole situation. I don't want them to get mad at me too. Take a peek at this puppy. Fruity Pebbles and Lucky Charms threaten to block healthy food labeling guidelines in court. saying it limits their free speech.
[speaker] Proposed FDA rule mandates that foods labeled as healthy must contain a major food group such as dairy, fruits, or whole grains, and must fit certain limits on saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars. The rule limits cereals, for example, to no more than 2.5 grams of sugar per serving in order to be labeled healthy. A restriction food manufacturers claim would exclude over 95% of ready to eat cereals. Holy shit. Yes. What?
[speaker] Which is great. That is good news. That's huge. It's about fucking time. I couldn't tell you the amount of people. that for some reason are brainwashed into believing these fucking labels that they're goddamn frosted flakes or whatever are healthy for them. It's nuts. That is long overdue. Among the most vocal food companies are producers of high sugar cereals, which are largely the children have been criticized as a driver of the obesity epidemic in America. Because they are.
[speaker] cried the proposed nutritional criteria and threatened to file a lawsuit challenging the guidelines as a violation of corporate free speech rights. you absolute slimy worms corporate free speech rights to lie to consumers. We have a right to say whatever we want to sell our products. And how dare you try and strip that from us, even though it's a blatant lie. Most cereal like Captain Crunch, Frosted Flakes, Lucky Charms, Fruity Pebbles are not healthy.
[speaker] and that it's a complete fucking sham and a joke that some of those boxes have that term plastered. on there. In the serial industry, the word healthy has less meaning than the word literally. It is completely devalued because they've been able to skirt these guidelines and get away with labeling things like fucking lucky charms as healthy when it's not. It's there for one purpose and one purpose only. to mislead customers into thinking that what they're purchasing isn't bad for them.
[speaker] Even though it's nothing but a giant fucking sugar bomb, you're purchasing just a ton of sugar. And for some reason they've been able to call it healthy for a long time. Now it's very deceptive. It's literally just false advertisement. And I don't think that slanders to say, I don't know if General Mills and Kellogg's are watching this, but I don't think that's slanderous. There is tons and tons of research to indicate the role. that high sugar shit like cereal plays a massive role.
[speaker] in the obesity epidemic that America's been experiencing for quite some time now. And finally, the FDA is doing something worthwhile of stepping in and saying it's about time we restrict this a little bit more. You can't just slam healthy on anything you want to willy-nilly. We're gonna stop being so loosey-goosey with healthy from now on it's going to need to adhere to stricter guidelines. I'm actually surprised they didn't
[speaker] double down. Instead of calling their foods healthy, I'm surprised they didn't try and say like, doctor recommended, cinnamon toast crunch. Uh, number one pediatrician recommended fruity pebbles. Like really go hog wild on trying to mislead people into thinking it's good for you. They did go hard on fortified for a while, saying it's fortified with crucial vitamins and minerals and all that. but I feel like they could have gone even more hog wild with it. About protein cereals that cost like $8 a box.
[speaker] You're getting into these really fringe serials I don't know about. I can't... I can't tell you which which are healthy and what aren't the ones you're listing. All I'm saying is I'm agreeing that 95% of these cereals would absolutely be wiped from the healthy label, because they're not. Like they're straight up not. The sugar that's present there isn't like natural sugars either, most of the time.
[speaker] So you can't even make it the argument that like, oh no, but what about the cereal with 30 grams of sugar, but it's all healthy sugars. because that's never the case. The rule, if finalized in its present form, the companies wrote, would be open to legal challenge in that it violates the first amendment by prohibition. truthfully, non-misleading claims in an unjustified manner and also exceeds FDA statutory authority in several ways. It's so frightening that corporations can bully an organization whose sole
[speaker] goal should be the safety of the products that we consume on a daily basis. prohibiting truthful non misleading claims, but that is the exact opposite of what these claims are, slapping healthy on fruity pebbles is an affront to god. The organization contend that the healthy labeling requirements are an unconstitutional overreach of government power. Food companies, the Washington Legal Foundation argued, have constitutionally protected commercial speech rights.
[speaker] covering their ability to use the term healthy to describe their added sugar products. This is terrifying. This is just scary. What the fuck? Nobody should want a world where corporations can pull claims out of their ass without ever having to prove them or verify their authenticity or ensure that the claims are truthful. That is a horrifying world. They could literally be boxing up poison and selling it to you with a smile on their face and with the word healthy slapped on the box.
[speaker] and nothing would be done about it. They are fighting tooth and nail to defend their right to literally fucking lie to customers. about how healthy their foods are. They are not by any stretch of imagination, by any definition, healthy and yet they've been able to get away with using that term for so long that they refuse to let it go. they become so accustomed to lying to their consumers. that they are now throwing this massive public hissy fit, this legal battle.
[speaker] The FDA, the Washington Legal Foundation, wrote in its brief, cannot explain why consumers cannot make their own health decisions based on nutritional labeling data rather it seeks to limit the food company's speech. Oh my god, it's like listening to someone cry victim on Twitter but from a corporation. What are you talking about, man? You're just blatantly lying on your products.
[speaker] Obesities on like an absolute astronomical come up and you're slapping healthy on some of the foods that are a big contributor of it. What are you talking about? The group does not disclose its donors and did not respond to a request for comments. In previous years, the Corm Refiners Association, a lobby group, that represents the high fructose corn syrup industry has disclosed financial ties to the Washington Legal Foundation.
[speaker] Can't believe that drug companies including Purdue Pharma, the makers of Oxycontin have used the Washington Legal Foundation to challenge government. rules and establish legal president to reduce the ability for prosecutors to seek criminal charges for drug company executives. You love a story with some heroes you can root for like the Washington Legal Foundation fighting for the little guys like drug company executives. The joint filing from serial manufacturers not only scorn the labeling rules,
[speaker] but also argue that sugary cereals pose no health risks and are in effect beneficial to society and childhood health. Love that. What a great claim. The company stated that they view the extremely strict guidelines as alarming because cereal is one of the most affordable nutrient dense bread. choices a person adult or child can make with a wide range of options to suit different cultures, preferences, and tastes. Serial companies claimed
[speaker] are cereals the companies claimed are already recognized for nutritional benefits. given their inclusion in a range of federal programs that serve the nation's vulnerable populations. such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women. infants and children and the National School Lunch Program. This is so foul. It's candy in the morning. It is, it is literally candy in the morning. And yet they're here with a straight face saying that it's nutrient dense.
[speaker] It is one of the most nutrient dense breakfast choices a person, adult or child can make. and saying that it poses no health risks and is actually beneficial to society and childhood health. That is so crazy. That is so crazy. Next, they're going to argue nutritional facts are unconstitutional. Yeah, we shouldn't have to say what's in our cereals. We shouldn't have to say what's in our food. It's to protect our right to privacy. Oh man this is so fucked up.
[speaker] How does this just keep getting worse? The company's charged that cereal delivers on nutrition when eaten alone. But when consumed as part of a breakfast, it elevates the nutrition further with cereal. eaters exhibiting an overall higher diet quality as Evidence the filings cites a 2019 study conducted by in-house researchers employed by General Mills, the maker of Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Trix, among other brands.
[speaker] They're doing it again right in front of our face. Do you guys remember? And I've talked about it a lot, but some of you might also remember there was a period of time, not that long ago, like 25, 30 ish years ago, where the entire America. All of America vilified fat. They said the fat in our food is making us fat. This is why we're getting obese. because of fat in our food and sugar was actually looked at as the good guy. Those studies were paid for by companies like this that were
[speaker] trying to placate their responsibility for the contribution they played to the obesity epidemic. and put all of it on top of fat. And they're doing it again right here in 2019. trying to make arguments that eating cereal actually helps eaters exhibit an overall higher diet quality I guess. That's so crazy. UGH! The agency they wrote should recognize the beneficial role of sugar! Sugar plays a role in foods beyond palatability. It controls water activity, creates texture.
[speaker] adds bulk and also contributes to flavor complexity. We are actually, we are literally going back in time. literally going back in time. They're trying to make sugar a hero again. Sugar is actually really good for you. It is healthy to eat 30 grams of sugar in the morning with our cereal. Independent research, however, have found that diets high in processed foods and sugar intake are linked to obesity. diabetes, higher risk of stroke, obesity related cancers, hypertension and dental diseases.
[speaker] You don't say. You're telling me that the research that wasn't paid for by the actual sugar producing cereal company? said something totally different? That I just can't believe. I'm sure we've all had that experience of someone telling us they're going to do something, but they never really do. keep making excuses and pushing it further and further down the line until you eventually forget about it or you just die of old age.
[speaker] Well, that's what I've been doing to a lot of you for about a year now. And today I'm finally putting a stop to it. I've been listening and just making the conscious decision to not do what you've been asking me, but I'm done with my rebellious stage now. I'll play ball, I'll play along. So, what am I talking about? I'm sure you've noticed, over the last year or so, I've slowly built up this room until it's resembled this fucking 16 chapel I'm in right now. And a lot of people have been asking me to like...
[speaker] do a little room tour because I thought it was cool as I was slowly adding things in here like it was a goddamn Sims characters room. And I just kept saying, oh yeah, I'll eventually do that once I get this or that. Oh, I'll do it, you know, in like a week or two once I find the Tesseract. or the all spark and put it in here in the display case and this and that just always making up excuses and pushing it further down the line
[speaker] And one of the biggest complaints that came from this is when I originally had the Godslap poster behind me, the previous one before this new one, it eventually slipped out of the frame and was like hanging down and it was really mismatched and uneven for like two months. and people blew a gasket. They were having a conniption, begging me to fix it, but all I kept saying is, oh I don't need to fix it, I'm getting a new frame soon.
[speaker] And that went on for months. I was leading you on like your crush who wasn't reciprocating your feelings, but was still just pretending to. knowing full well that the frame wasn't in production or anything until very recently. The point is, a lot of people have been asking me to show off this room that I've been building for quite some time, and today I'm finally going to do that.
[speaker] I mean shit the whole point in me switching rooms in the first place was because this one's a little bit bigger so I had more space to play with. And I've just been really slow to do that. I'll also go ahead and quickly answer the question people also ask of what did I do with the other room? I just... I just mainly use it for storage now. So when you first step foot in my dojo, my domain, you'll see this God slap frame on the floor.
[speaker] because I haven't decided where I want to hang it. I have been framing more shit than a supervillain in an old 90s noir cartoon. I have become obsessed with framing things I like and of course I love God Slap it's our comic series issue 3 just dropped here's a little shameless plug for that So that's the first thing you'll see when you come in. Then you walk past my dog tent here.
[speaker] which has a motion-activated booby trap which is a talking toy that just spouts the scariest shit in the middle of the night saying things like I found a booby trap I see you and the one you just heard. Oh, no that kind of shit. It's literally like a jump-scare device, but not for my dogs, just for me in the middle of the night. That's where Kata usually sleeps and she gets to sleep right next to me.
[speaker] this beautiful collection of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. Everything is first edition. I even bought a display case to show up. off even more cards and make it look absolutely beautiful just drop dead gorgeous. The cards behind it were complete sets like Legend of Blue Eyes 1st edition, here's all the collectors rare. There's OST packs, Turbo pack, Astral pack. Those with a keen eye will also notice the original tournament pack cards there the mechanical chaser needleworm morphing jar then there's the 1998 bandit
[speaker] I set of Yu-Gi-Oh cards including that original Mirror Force. There's my Duel Knight Championship trophy that I won in a tournament with Team Samurai where I absolutely popped the fuck off and slapped everyone around. And then just more beautiful cards that I really like. So a lot of Dark Magicians, a lot of Blue. Blue Eyes. Here's some boxes that I opened including a Legend of Blue Eyes first edition box. and those binders there contain every single Yu-Gi-Oh! card ever printed in ultra rare and above.
[speaker] Now before showing you more of this holy sanctuary, I would like to take a... Quick break to talk about today's video sponsor, Rocket Money. money for sponsoring today's video. I imagine most of you don't even realize. how many subscriptions you have right now, since everything in the world has a subscription service. and that was the case for me as well. And that's where Rocket Money comes in. Rocket Money is an all-in-one platform that allows you to save more and save more.
[speaker] spin less. Their finance app allows you to manage your subscriptions, lower your your bills, set custom budgets, and also grow your savings in one place. I'm using Rocket Money to help manage my subscription since There's so many that are out there now. Sometimes I lose track on which ones.

So if you're interested in rocket money, you can go to rocket.

Here's some shelves that I filled with items that are important to me. So there you can see the Mummy collector DVD set, which is Mummy 1 and 2. right there my two favorite movies then of course I have the streamer awards variety streamer of the year winner trophy
[speaker] These are anime that I absolutely loved growing up or currently do love. And then here's all of my favorite albums from when I was young. So you're gonna, Hybrid Theory is my favorite album of all time, but you're gonna see some fucking bangers in here. Deftones, White Pony, fucking Thousand Foot Crutch, Tool, Cybreed soil work like it's all the bangers boner jams on top of boner jams And then these are my favorite cartoons growing up. So I courage a cowardly dog, Avatar invaders.
[speaker] all of that. Just a lot of good nostalgic things that I'd like to fill this shelf with. Right next to that I have this frame filled with every starlight rare for Yu-Gi-Oh ever printed. Underneath that is... every ghost rare from Yu-Gi-Oh! ever printed including the error ghost rares like the rainbow dragon. And then underneath that I have the entire Gold Star Pokemon set and of course a Shining Charizard, which I didn't want graded, but the only one available was a graded one. I think Grading Car.
[speaker] is a fucking scam. That's my hot take for this video. I think that shit is worthless. Unless you're trying to like buy and sell the cards but with anything aside from that don't even bother fucking grading them. But yeah, here's all my gold star Pokemon cards I've collected over the years. And then here's full sets. So here's the entire Team Rocket set. Most of these I pulled myself from first edition boxes a couple of years ago.
[speaker] Next to that we have probably my favorite set. This is all first edition Neo Geo. Genesis cards, a lot of these I pulled myself as well. Here's all first edition jungle cards. You got a fucking thousand Snorlaxes there all first ed all hollows of course So the main goal with my Pokemon collecting was I wanted to get every single card that's ever been printed in first edition which is only the first 11 sets when was of the Coast had it and then they eventually stopped doing first eds but I just love first
[speaker] edition cards in general so I wanted to collect all of those and then I eventually added the gold star to that list that I wanted to finish the collection of because I already collected a few of those from when I was younger. So that's kind of the gist of my Pokemon collection. These are all of those first edition sets fully. Completed so there you can see like the shining Gyarados and everything like that next to that you can see the shining Mewtwo
[speaker] Shining Mewtwo, Shining Tyranitar, Shining Raichu, all wonderful cards are great. set and then next to that is just some miscellaneous cards from when I was a kid so like the ancient Mew. and some other sentimental priceless treasure that I collected from when I was a young boy. I completed my Pokemon collection so I don't currently still collect them. I do with you. but my Pokemon one I consider completed so I beat that addiction to Pokemon cards
[speaker] Here's my base set first edition Pokemon cards. These are the holy rail of Pokemon collecting. I think they're absolutely beautiful so I got a great frame for those. At the top my G-Fuel fridges which are filled with Divine Peach. Next to that I have these. shadow boxes for my favorite pieces of merch that we've made. So the moist hoodie, the moist... eSports track jacket and the moist eSports jersey. All of these go so fucking hard.
[speaker] I swear to god, wearing that merch feels better than wearing my own fucking skin. And then there's this stunning piece here, this mor- global light-up sign that was made by a company called Brinex Solutions and really this whole room is just kind of a museum. of shit that's important to me. And I've got this whole motherfuckers RGB gamer lighted out of the wazoo here. so everything's got like lights on it. It looks like you're in a fucking spaceship that's piloted by the biggest nerd in the cosmos.
[speaker] These shelves are like a little shrine I made for my favorite video games and video game consoles. Unfortunately a lot of my favorite games and all of the things that that I used to play growing up. I traded into GameStop like 10 years ago. to go, which was like literally a thousand games and countless memories. all of which went to GameStop's cum dumpster and they gave me fifteen bucks in return for all of it or something. That screwdriver there isn't like an homage to Tommy Pickles or anything.
[speaker] I just forgot it there after building something. But yeah, it's kind of the whole video game Shrine. Here's my PC. It's of course a Starforge. It's on top of these shelves which just kind of house a bunch of cords that I might need at some point So I just put them all in there This is my battle station, my little gamer zone. It's a pretty standard 3 monitor. set up nothing too wild and wacky about that. I used to only use one monitor then I graduated to two but then I'd really
[speaker] really fucking saw the light with three after a buddy of mine convinced me that it was worth it. So I realized that up until now, Until I got that third monitor, I was granny-shifting, not double-clutching like I should. Yeah, it's lucky I didn't blow the fucking welds off the intake. And then that's my water glass, which is the most generic chalice of all time, I'm pretty sure.
[speaker] Everyone watching this probably drinks from the exact same glass, because it seems like that's the most common fucking thing in the world. world. Also I just noticed there's a bit of a leak here but I don't feel like re-recording it. So I'll just go ahead and call attention to it and this will be how I announce it I guess. That top monitor is... is actually the cover to another comic series I've been working on for the last year called Plague.
[speaker] Seeker. So that'll be coming out later this year. And now we get to the stuff you see behind me in every video so these are the YouTube play buttons as well as the that slippery when what sign that my dad made which I think was absolutely adorable. This is a nice little fireplace shelf unit that I haven't really used yet. I haven't decided what to put there. And then here's the new God Slap poster display and comic book display. This bad boy.
[speaker] replace the previous posters which a lot of people called attention to for being uncool. uneven so now you can rejoice and sleep easy knowing that that's no longer a problem Yeah, so that's the whole room so far. I do still plan on adding quite a bit to it. until every goddamn inch of this room has something on it that means something to me. I've become really into like decorating this room. So yeah, maybe I'll do another room tour in like another year. But anyway, that's about it. See ya.
[speaker] There's been a huge update to the Justin Roiland situation, a new chapter has dropped and man what a plot twist this one came with. I'm sure all of you already know, but I'll just briefly bring you up to speed since it's been a couple of months. It recently came to light that Justin Roiland has been secretly battling domestic battery and false imprisonment. charges from his ex girlfriend. He was accused following an incident in 2020 and since then
[speaker] over the last few years has gone to like pre-trials and hearings about the situation and all of it was revealed. earlier this year which shocked the world and left the Rick and Morty fans thoroughly squashed. Following this news, Justin Roiland was fired from Adult Swim. He was fired from solar opposites and he resigned from his development studio, Squanch Key. It was also scheduled to go into the next phase of all of this with a trial. However, today, everyone's trick hole got glorbed.
[speaker] It was announced that the domestic violence charges against Justin Royland, this whole case, was dismissed. According to a spokesperson for the... the district attorney's office, they said, we dismissed the charges today because there was insufficient evidence to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. They further added that significant additional information came to light.
[speaker] That additional information that came to light that surfaced here in the fourth quarter with the buzzer beater to stop this from going to trial. is not elaborated upon. It hasn't been made public, obviously, so we can only speculate. I have no fucking idea what it could have been. Maybe Justin Royland sent a rough draft for Rick and Morty season 9 to the district attorney and he loved it so much he dismissed the case on the spot.
[speaker] There's no telling. Nothing about the case really has ever been made public. Not even the actual incident that occurred in 2020. None of it has been made public. So a lot of this has just been through. legal speak and pretty vague about the actual occurrence as well as the particulars around it. So this additional information that eventually led to the case being dismissed. We don't know what it was. So because of that, it's left a lot of people on Twitter to start talking about.
[speaker] how foul play could have been involved here, some under the table dealings, bribery or... Things like that. Corruption. I don't know about all of that. There's really no telling since again, none of the information about any of this was ever really made public. Though I will admit I do think it is a little odd how quickly it got thrown out once it made it into the media cycle This has been something that's been going on for a few years now. I'm assuming their muscle...
[speaker] have been some level of substantiated evidence behind the claims. Otherwise, how How the fuck would it have made it this far along the legal process? I would imagine this would have got slapped. immediately if they never had any evidence in the first place just this giant fucking nothing burger. I assume there must have been something, but now they're citing insufficient evidence to support the claims. So I do get why people are a little.
[speaker] a little heebie-jeebie about it, I do understand. And like I said in my last video, I am still surprised that adult swim and Solar Opposites both acted so quickly to shit can Royland before he was ever even found guilty on the charges. I assumed at the time that they must have had additional information that the public didn't have in the insights and the inner workings of this case and they fired Roiland based on that.
[speaker] But it's looking like that wasn't the case since he is presumably innocent now since this case has been dropped. So that leads me to believe that either they acted in order to wipe the dog shit of his reputation off of their shoe as quickly as possible is to not hurt their brand. And it was just bad off. to keep him around or they fired him based on all of the other allegations against him. against them, some of which were made by co-workers and still current employees of these productions.
[speaker] None of these have been fully confirmed, so of course take them with a grain of salt. But a lot of his co-workers have come out very strong against him. Citing that he was extremely lazy and actually hadn't had an active role in the development of Rick and Morty in a long time, refusing to work, difficult to work with. And the way some other colleagues talk about him make it sound like he was an actual toddler in the office. So they'd say like they didn't even...
[speaker] even know he was in until they'd hear his dogs or his remote control toy car zooming around the office. So they describe him as just being difficult to work with and that they didn't really like his presence, which I guess... may have been something adult swim and solar opposites would have taken into account. And then a lot of these... degenerate DMs started leaking. Of course, none of the sources are a hundred percent confirmed as authentic or anything.
[speaker] He would flirt as if he was actually fucking Morty from the show in real life. So he'd say things like in saying in the membrane and like, a-hoo-ga, boobies, boobies. Like the text messages were really fucking embarrassing. And there are even allegations that at least of the people that he was flirting with was underage and you know others were like people he had worked with before. None of it has been confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt, like as 100% real or anything, but this was just another
[speaker] big shitstorm that Justin Roiland was facing in the midst of all of this and a lot of allegations. Now, since the case has been dismissed, he has made a statement, but he doesn't address anything. outside of the felonies he was facing. Royland says, I've always known known that these claims are false and I had never had any doubt that this day would come. I'm thankful that this case has been the
[speaker] but at the same time I'm still deeply shaken by the horrible lies that were reported about me during this process. Most of all, I'm disappointed that so many people were so quick to judge without knowing the facts. Based solely on the word of- of an embittered ex trying to bypass due process and have me cancelled. that it may have succeeded even partially is shameful. However, now that the legal case has ended, I'm determined to move forward and focus both on my creative projects and restoring my good name.
[speaker] the word cancelled here when all of these charges were private. None of this was ever made public the X has never come out publicly. None of the information has ever been made. all of this was handled behind closed doors and only made it to the public eye because of some sleuthing from media outlets I believe since the trial was not too far into the future. If the allegations are actually false. I still don't know if cancellation would have been the motivation behind it.
[speaker] because I feel like if the goal was cancellation, the X would have come forward and publicly revealed all of this information instead of trying to handle it legally. Like that wouldn't really make sense for that goal if it was cancellation to try and handle it like behind closed doors. I feel like they would have wanted to do everything in their power to like publicly drag Justin Roiland around and talk about all of this.
[speaker] And as you can imagine, a lot of people aren't super happy about Royland's response here. citing that he doesn't really seem to understand that even though he was able to prove his innocence to the legal system and prove it least that the charges didn't have enough evidence to support them. They weren't strong enough to lead to a conviction on the accusations. That innocence wasn't proven to the public. And in fact, the public has never.
[speaker] even known exactly what the fuck even happened in the first place with the incident. So a lot of people took issue with him talking about how disappointed he is that people believed the lies from his embittered ex. Which I do agree is kind of odd because, again, there's never been any specifics about what happened or even what this whole thing is even about. than the fact that Royland for a few years now has had two felonies that he's been fighting, domestic violence and false imprisonment.
[speaker] and people were talking about like, oh wow, that's pretty concerning that that's happening. Those are scary charges. So that's all people have ever had access to. And even now, after the case has been dismissed. People still don't know what the fuck was even going on to begin with. All of the evidence in every- has been kept under lock and key. So even though the charges got dropped for a lot of people. that's not good enough since he wasn't proven innocent publicly since
[speaker] None of the information is public. So a lot of people are still saying that there is a chance that. There really was a victim here that was just unable to provide enough evidence. to convince others that this event happened, even if it really did. So it's just been a mess. So all the public can do is look at the fact that he was battling these very serious felonies and say fuck That's not good. That is scary. Those aren't, you know, light felonies by any means.
[speaker] That's the only information that the public has ever had access to and the only thing that they can base. their perspective on. Now that the case has been dismissed, obviously that changes a bit. And if all of the allegations are truly false, then that is a crime in and of itself and should be taken very seriously. If it is proven... that everything that has happened was based upon an embittered ex lying to ruin Justin Royland's reputation and try and ruin his life.
[speaker] That is a very serious thing as well that also needs to be addressed. So the whole thing is just a pretty fucking horrible situation top to bottom. Again, he doesn't talk about any of the other allegations, at least not yet. I imagine he probably will going forward. especially the ones from the co-workers and the DMs. But anyway, just wanted to give a quick update on all of this and that's about it. See ya.
[speaker] For a while I've talked about something that I feel a lot of people overlook, and it's the importance of stuntmen. Their work is some of the most important in all of movies in general. And I always have such a deep. appreciation for the art. Especially growing up on things like Jackie Chan movies. I've always paid very close attention. to stunt work. And today I saw a video on Twitter that really just inspired me, tickled my Elmo and made me want to just...
[speaker] talk about this because this stunt guy is a goddamn hero and he may very well be immortal.
[different_speaker] 3, 2, 1, action! Alice!!!
[speaker] When I first watched this I thought they just tossed a doll down this stairs like a dummy in order to make it look like someone got thrown down the stairs. until the very end I realized holy shit that's a living breathing human being in the comments. thrown out like a trash bag, a slinky going down the escalator here. So then I watched it back and I was like, okay, maybe he's in like some kind of full-body suit of medieval armor to help with the impact here. Kinda like that guy who built the anti-grizzly
[speaker] bear suit and he used to like get hit by trucks and shit to prove how strong it was. But then I realized he's not doing that either. He does have some kind of like padding on himself But it's kind of light, he looks like one of Shredder's ninjas from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So while there is padding there, it's not like he's in some kind of juggernaut bomb defusal squad uniform here. It's pretty light.
[speaker] and it seems to be a real escalator. I don't know what you can really do to modify an escalator to make falling like that. hurt less. Even if each one of those steps was a memory foam pillow, It would still hurt quite a bit because that's a long fall and he does a few times He like lands on the back of his neck, unlike that second one there. So, you know, it seems like a pretty risky stunt, but I have no doubt this guy probably did this with a fucking smile on his face because
[speaker] Stuntmen are actual warriors. They're fucking champions out there. I also wonder how many takes they've done of this Like this is probably like take number 12. It's like hey the first 11 were okay, but you weren't flailing around enough and we We really want like almost a neck breaking action when you're falling. So we're going to do this again until we can get that effect.
[speaker] You know, like they probably did this multiple times of him just getting fucking tomato canned down this escalator. It honestly kind of- It kind of reminds me of that iCarly scene where Gibby falls from like the roof onto just bare concrete. We had Noah Monk on the podcast who played Gibby in that show and he said that that was done for real. actually just fucking like belly flopped onto concrete and broke like all of his ribs.
[speaker] So when you see that impact of Gibby bouncing off the cement, that's a real person that that happened to, and his ribs paid the ultimate fucking price for it. And I have no doubt this is probably just as real, but somehow this guy seems like okay. Gibby had to be taken off on a stretcher after that. The stuntman, he had to be like... Goddamn take it out there like nearly had to call in the the chopper rescue unit to airlift them out Meanwhile this guy probably just walked it off
[speaker] rub some dirt in it. Like it's crazy. Stuntmen are actually super, super impressive. And I really hope they're being paid well for John Wick 4 here. This got me even more excited. for John Wick than I already was seeing a stunt like this. They didn't take some kind of easy way out with like CGI or using some kind of like animatronic or doll or something. They actually just had An absolute madman do this stunt for real and that is super fucking cool.
[speaker] Anyway, this wasn't the only thing I saw on Twitter that was inspirational. I saw something that was honestly a tear-jerking moment that I kind of just want to share with all of you. This is like a little bonus that I'd like to dive into. Recently, Hasbulla has been on this absolute blow up. He's easy. really popping off. Most people know who that is by now. He's got a very strong social media presence and people love him. And from everything I've seen, Hasbullah seems like a really nice, likeable guy.
[speaker] and he recently went on Mike Tyson's podcast, Mike Tyson's show. And things got real interesting real quick. Even just the way he's talking to him.
[different_speaker] L ****
[speaker] Oh Jesus Christ
[different_speaker] Yeah
[speaker] He like blows a raspberry on him. He had no idea that was a man. Honestly, it's just kind of like a wholesome thing. I don't think Hasbulla was offended or anything. I don't think Mike Tyson was upset that he He snuggled Hasbala like... I think it's just not a big deal. It's just something silly and fun. Now to be fair, Mike Tyson could do this same thing to me. He'd be like, hey Charles, throw some punches at me real quick, we'll toy around a little bit. I'd be like, alright, you got it Mr. Tyson.
[speaker] So I'm throwing these wet noodles at him and then he just picks me up and starts cradling me and rock me back and forth until I start to get drowsy. and maybe he starts like biting at my ear a little bit. Unsurprisingly, there were some people on Twitter that were very upset about this, and I mean that's par for the course you could post the cutest picture of your dog ever and you'll somehow outrage a thousand people on twitter.
[speaker] That's not surprising, but I do want to at least mention that I feel like in this case, this was just one of those moments where Mike Tate and made a bit of a blunder here, a boo-boo. It just feels like a truly victimless, harmless, wacky moment. Mike Tyson probably just wasn't too knowledgeable on who Hasbulla was before he was booked for the show. but it is just, it is super goofy. that he picks him up and then starts like nuzzling him and then
[speaker] he immediately starts chomping and biting at the ear of Hasbela. Which I think is like self aware from Mike Tyson here. I don't think that he's just. naturally drawn to like biting people's ears off or anything like that. I think that was just supposed to be like a joke and who knows this might have even been like a scripted planned thing and I fall in hook line and sinker for the bait. Regardless though, I think it is still just kind of a goofy...
[speaker] fun moment I suppose that I thought was worth at least mentioning. That's really about it. See ya. There's no shortage of horrible companies in the video game industry, but there's one that's been able to fly under the radar for way too long. too long now, even though it's just as slimy and scummy as some of the more mainstream ones people like to spit on. And that's Nexon.
[speaker] You've probably heard of them because of MapleStory, that's by far their biggest game, their magnum opus, the cash cow that they're addicted to. to milking and for a long time now they've been able to tiptoe around in the shadows hiding their stink from the public nostrils The last month they flew a little too close to the sun and we could start to smell their odor. and I swear to god it smelled like shit. About a month ago, they decided to start bullying a smaller developer named...
[speaker] I'm Iron Mace who's working on a game that I am a massive fan of called Dark and Darker. I played every playtest so far. so far and I have been absolutely loving it. But love is a concept that doesn't exist at Nexon. Only cold hard dollar bills that they were missing out on. They're like the Mr. Krabs of video games So they started to put Iron Mace in their crosshairs claiming that the dark and darker developers stole from Nexon.
[speaker] They said that not only did they steal code from an unreleased project at Nexon called P3, they stole assets from that project. And basically the claims boiled down to there was an employee at Nexon back in 2021. who was working on a project called P3 that is similar to Dark and Darker. That employee apparently was talking about like leaving and starting their own company kind of expanding upon this P3 idea, he ended up being fired and then you know fast forward to late
[speaker] 2022 we have dark and darker which bears some resemblance to that P3P. projects. So Nexon is claiming that they stole from them citing assets and code that was ripped directly from that unreleased project, as well as idea theft saying that that this was a Nexon idea and thus they don't really have the right to use it. Which is why that title is you can't copyright a game genre because this is an extraction style game. It's just
[speaker] that's well established, the only spin on it is instead of being guns like Tarkov, it's medieval weaponry. and it fucking bangs. This shit fucks. It is amazing. I love dark and darker. And unfortunately now, Nexon has gone so far as to issue a police raid on their studio headquarters and as I understand it they didn't find anything there. They reassured fans. that it was quick and nothing was found and there will be no delay in development and nothing to worry
[speaker] about so I'm guessing they went there and got a giant fucking nothing sandwich served to them there was I suppose no stolen code, no hidden secret documents from now on. on no Krabby Patty secret formula just some hard-working developers and their project But that's not where this story stops. In fact, today. This is why we're talking about it. Today, Nexon has once again escalated this conflict and... issued a full-blown cease and desist to Dark and Darker, which has led to it being pulled from steam.
[speaker] So effectively shut down for the time being, all based on these claims that it was stolen from them. Of course, Iron Mace denies all the allegations, saying that dark and darker's code was built from scratch and its assets were either purchased from the Unreal Marketplace place are designed internally and if you've played Dark and Darker you're going to notice like Half of the assets in this game come from the Unreal Marketplace. I play a lot of shit.
[speaker] it on Steam new releases and I can recognize half of the models in dark and dark from all of the other games I've played. And that's not a problem, the assets are there for a reason. Plus, it's still in very early playtesting stages, so of course they're gonna be using assets. I don't know what fucking assets they're even claiming are stolen from Nexon unless Nexon has some kind of monopoly on the Unreal Marketplace.
[speaker] where it's all their assets. They're like the kingpin and their drug empire is the unreal marketplace. It just doesn't make any sense. Because, again... half or even maybe more than half of Dark and Darker uses just standard store-bought, real assets. an argument that some of these assets are stolen from Nexon's unreleased P3 project because again and so much of Dark and Darker is unreal assets. Like, I can't imagine them being like, Oh my God!
[speaker] That rock that's in the middle of that prison cell is actually from P3, I'd recognize it anywhere. That is a distinct rock that was developed... in-house at Nexon, it's our pride and joy. Oh my god, and that chalice that players can collect, that golden goblet of fire. That was from Nexon. Yeah, you've stolen it from us. Like, I don't know where there's even wiggle room for them to- make claims that some of these assets were stolen because so much is from fucking unreal assets.
[speaker] But regardless, moving forward, Iron Mace developers have of course made a statement about this whole thing. we have recently been served a cease and desist letter and DMC takedown by Nexon regarding Dark and Darker based on distorted claims. We are currently working with our legal team to remedy this issue in the best manner possible due to the sensitive legal nature of this issue we must be careful with our statements so as to not jeopardize
[speaker] possible, please know that we will do all that is possible for our fans. Thanks. Very sweet message, throughout this entire discourse, Iron Mesa seemed extremely professional. I just want to point that out. They have seemed like absolute sweethearts here in the face of bullshit. This to me, I'll break this down and give my whole perspective on this after research. all of it. This to me feels like Nexon bullying a smaller company because they
[speaker] They feel like they've missed out on a golden goose here because dark and darker has become extremely popular and they did have an idea that was similar to it called P3. P3 never got off the ground, Dark and Darker did. This really feels like it's almost some level of vengeance and spike. against Dark and Darker's success. Nexon has hundreds and millions of dollars they can throw into the shitter at this and
[speaker] Completely bleed iron mace dry since they are a smaller company and they're going to fight this legal battle tooth and nail it seems Which is extremely upsetting considering these claims aren't 100% proven to be accurate anyway. In fact, At least according to police raid, they didn't even find any evidence to support the claims, but yet they've still managed to DMCA cease and desist this game and get it removed from Steam.
[speaker] and now Iron Mace is going to have to engage in a lengthy and very expensive legal battle with this absolute titan of douchebaggery. Next on is... is just an absolute trash company and even if every single one of their claims is accurate, 100% truthful, there's still a lot of truth in it. still a horrible garbage piece of shit company regardless. Even from everything outside of Dark and Darker, even before this they've been a terrible company.
[speaker] but this especially. And I'll go a step further. Maybe we're getting into dicey spicy territory here, but I'm just gonna say it with my whole chest. If all of Nexon's claims are accurate, Dark and Darker did take that idea from Nexon. and build upon it and even if they used a couple of assets that they developed while working at Nexon I don't give a fuck. In fact, I view them more as heroes. I respect them more if they did that. Because Nexon...
[speaker] can suck the dirtiest part of my asshole. I cannot stand that company. I think that would be great if that really was the case. I don't think the Nexon Corporation should have the legal right to have this stranglehold on a video game idea that they didn't even make themselves. This idea was cooked up by the creative minds that were let go from Nexon in the first place, thus, since they're no longer at- next one.
[speaker] own studio, even though that idea was something they may have had while working elsewhere. They are no longer working there. That comes from the fact that they are not working in the studio anymore. is no longer working on that project, thus the team that actually made the idea and the prototypes should be able to take that work and build upon it on their own. I don't know if that's a hot take, but again, assuming every claim from Nexon is accurate, even still...
[speaker] it makes it clear that the idea and the work was done by employees that were let go from Nexon. Thus, It shouldn't be their idea anymore, Nexon's idea. It should be the individual's idea who actually came up with it in the first place. Thus I feel like they should have the right to continue to work on it if they choose to. But again, it's important to reiterate that as of right now, there's still no real harm Hard evidence against Iron Mace. Nothing that's really supportive.
[speaker] reporting Nexon's big claims of stolen code, stolen assets and shit like that. So we're just gonna have to wait to see how all this unfolds, but it's really disappointing to see that Dark and Darker is no longer up on- because another playtest was right around the corner that I was extremely excited for, as were a lot of people. Hopefully this situation can get resolved pretty quickly. That's about it. See ya. I went over to my family's house for dinner a couple nights ago.
[speaker] And my father was raving and couldn't stop talking. about a case I'd never heard of that apparently is just wrapped up. The Alex Murdoch murder case. And in fact, it extends beyond that. The entire Murdoch family murders. This is a very high profile case that I just hadn't... heard of until my father started lecturing me on it like I had just taken a criminology course. He apparently followed every single piece of evidence that dropped. He watched every trial, everything. My dad studied the
[speaker] tits off of this case like he was going there to prosecute Alex Murdoch himself. And it piqued my interest. It made me want to learn more about it. So I went to the best goddamn channel on YouTube for things like this. Legal Eagle. Legal Eagle recently made a full beautiful breakdown going over every single piece of evidence and every single key point in the entire Murdaugh history.
[speaker] So I'm gonna put a link to that in the description, but I just kind of wanted to share it with all of you because this is one of the more. more deep and disturbing cases I've learned about in quite a while. So I just wanted to share kind of the gist of it with all of you, but I highly recommend watching LegalCity. Eagles video on it if you want to learn the most about it and see how everything unfolded. You see the Murdaugh murders. So my dad just told me about that, I didn't know anything about it.
[speaker] and he was apparently embezzling money for a long time, a pathological liar. an oxy, an oxy addict. and he snapped and killed his son and wife. My dad was telling me all about it apparently. Er, not apparently. My dad was telling me all about it. Apparently, it was a wild case and I didn't hear shit about it. Yeah, apparently the prosecutors had a video. that the sun had recorded that showed, that proved that Alex Murdahl was lying about his whereabouts on the night of the murders.
[speaker] So I guess the story was... They were killed at like the dog kennels on their property. Alex Murdoch claimed that he wasn't there that night at the kennels and he had like couple alibis because they had his whole phone record apparently called a ton of people to try and get alibi. to try and get a couple alibis. And eventually the prosecutors showed a video that his son had recorded literally minutes before he was murdered.
[speaker] His son he killed also got in a boat accident that killed a girl named Mallory Beach. and also was the only witness to his housekeeper dying, and he had bezeled her life insurance. Oh, what the fuck?
[different_speaker] Los Angeles area double murder expert OJ Simpson predicted that the Elec Murdoch jury would have quit the Lowcountry Lawyer of double murder. don't really work for murders he wasn't directly involved in. wouldn't surprise me in the least.
[speaker] It's crazy. It is crazy. We have OJ Simpson on Twitter. Dropping reaction videos. giving his opinion on how another murderer... could potentially beat their case. I blows my mind. Randolph Murdoch senior was elected solicitor in 1920.
[different_speaker] and served until he was killed by a freight train in 1940.
[speaker] Sounds like a murder. That sounds like an actual old western murder where they tied him to the train tracks. Don't know the situation, it literally just sounds like he was murdered.
[different_speaker] Now some people suspect that the freight train incident was a suicide because no one could figure out why Randolph's car stalled on the track.
[speaker] But Murdoch senior was succeeded by his son, Randolph Murdoch Jr. known as Buster. who held the position for 46 years. Cool nickname. 1942 on two separate occasions.
[different_speaker] 20 years apart, he told jurors that if they didn't impose the death penalty on a criminal defendant. he would use his power as solicitor. to release other rapists into the community. No. You heard that right. Oh, wait. It's hard to imagine a worse thing a prosecutor could say in court. but I'm sure pros.
[speaker] And he got to keep the position? He would make these threats like, okay, if he doesn't get the death penalty, five rapists will go into Gotham. He sounds like the Joker. What? elected official so he just campaigns and pays off the right people. Yeah, but I'm sure there's still systems in place where if you're threatening to release rapists out of like a uh... grudge you can get fired like you can get like taken out Like you lose your position.
[speaker] I would think because it was the 70s. It's not like rape was cool in the 70s either. I'm sure people weren't like like rallying behind him like yeah that's fucking Buster right there that's how Buster plays get the death penalty or 50 rapists. Buster, release 50 rapists into the neighborhood. The guy really had rapists in the queue to join the server. Oh, you're talking about Buster still. Yeah. I don't, I'm just going to take a guess that the other Murdochs didn't use the same tactic.
[different_speaker] Alex Murda, now convicted murderer. is Randolph the Third's son.
[speaker] All of this information is to show you that the entire Murdaugh line is fucking evil. basically. Now that you're brought up to speed on where Alex Murdoch comes from Let's talk about his kids because His kids are no saints. Legal Eagle goes into more detail surrounding some of the these cases but I just like to give you a quick breakdown if you want more information obviously watch his video on it But one of Alex's sons, Buster, who is named after, of course, Buster...
[speaker] Murdaugh who came before him is actually a person of interest in a 2015 death. A young man named Stephen Smith was found dumped on a Hampton County road. There wasn't a whole lot of indicators to suggest. that this was a vehicle crash and in fact was even ruled a homicide by a couple of people, most notably the county coroner. And interestingly, Buster Murdaugh is mentioned dozens of times in the investigation.
[speaker] Also, Alex Murdaugh and his brother Randy visited the crime scene, passing through the crime scene tape. And there were rumors that Buster Murdaugh and Stephen Smith were in some kind of relationship. And this case actually just got reopened after the entire Alex Murdoch investigation. So that's all a bit peculiar. That doesn't seem good. Something smells very... fishy over there with Buster Murdaugh and he's not the only one. In fact, Alex Murdaugh's other son, Paul.
[speaker] In 2019, Paul and his friends were partying on a boat. At one point his friends say Paul and his girlfriend got in an argument where Paul assaulted her. And then eventually the night culminated with the boat crashing, everyone surviving except one person. Mallory Beach. Paul was blamed for the death because he was fucking driving the boat. He received two charges, one boating under the influence causing great bodily harm. and one boating under the influence causing death.
[speaker] So as you can see, the Murdoch family is known for more than just financial crimes. There's a lot of death linked to the family as well. And there's still more. There's still one that I haven't even talked about. One that happened before Alex Murdoch killed his son and wife. In 2018, their house... Housekeeper Gloria Satterfield allegedly tripped over one of their dogs and fell down the stairs and died at their hunting lodge Alex Murdaugh then instructed Gloria Satterfield's sons to sue him.
[speaker] for insurance money. However, he neglected to inform them that he had already collected on two settlements and basically robbed them of about $4.3 million. from the insurance here. The man is just pure evil, just a shriveled pruney fucking ghost looking motherfuck- whose entire bloodline seems cursed and is nothing but bad news. It is disgusting.
[different_speaker] because they allegedly kept a beer refrigerator at the hunting lodge. Underage Kids Read to Drink Up. given the scale of Alex's financial crime. discovery of his assets. would have revealed years of murder. Later that same night, Alex allegedly found Paul and Maggie dead outside the at the Murdaugh's sprawling hunting.
[speaker] I'm really trying to break this down into the most concise form possible just to convey like the general story. of the situation but again I can't recommend checking out LegalEagle's full video on it for the absolute like like best breakdown. In a nutshell, years and years and millions upon millions of dollars of stolen money and financial crimes were about to be brought to light, all of which Alex Murdaugh was panicked about. So the main theory behind his motive for killing Paul and his wife Maggie
[speaker] is he needed some way of buying time to weasel his way out of this situation. I shit you not. The murder of his son Paul and wife Maggie Right now the leading theory is he did it for sympathy, to portray himself as a victim, and to basically... just buy himself some extra time to get out of the situation because all of these financial crimes that have built up over years We're about to be fucking blasted. publicly all of it was going to come to light. So that was his plan.
[speaker] Now, Paul was murdered before he ever stood trial for the death of Mallory Beach. But I'm getting a little ahead of the story because there was one other... baffling situation that occurred involving hired hitman that Alex himself hired to shoot and kill him so his other son could get his insurance money. So Alex admitted to stealing from Chris.
[different_speaker] and blamed his behavior on an opium. and then hours later, that same day after that conversation with Chris. Alex was shot in the head. Yeah, seriously. Yeeeah! Is there like a far-fetched Netflix series yet?
[speaker] So I now we're at the part. that I know. Everything that preceded this. Pfff, fucking wild. no clue but now we're getting into the part that my dad was talking about and Now I'm kind of... in the know on where all this goes. Chat just educated me about this so I have the spoilers here. but I guess I won't drop the spoilers, but I see now. what has happened and how things have got to this point.
[different_speaker] Yeah, but I mean, I'm okay.
[speaker] Alex later admitted that he hired his cousin Eddie. to shoot him. Yep. So Alex's remaining son Buster could get the life insurance. Could get the life insurance. But apparently cousin Eddie wasn't up to the job because the gunshot was temporarily blinded.
[different_speaker] Maybe it would also turn out... What the fuck? Alex later admitted that he stole from his law partners and clients to fund his addiction to pain.
[speaker] My dad's calling me about the Murdoch shit that I just sent him with this. Hold on. Yeah, well, did you even know about all of the Murdock shit with his family? Like how his son is most likely responsible for deaths as well? Yeah, the boat.
[different_speaker] Yeah. Yeah
[speaker] Cuz I yeah, I just got to that point cousin Eddie to like a hitman to shoot him for the life insurance policy for buster
[different_speaker] Haha
[speaker] Okay, I didn't know if you knew any of that because you didn't mention it. That shit's crazy. Yeah, no, this is this is absolutely wild. I had no idea. It was like so deep reaching. Well, cool is like probably a weird word to use for it, but like it's, it's. fascinating. Like it feels like it's some kind of crazy movie. Yeah, he's really into the whole Murdoch shit. Yeah, like encyclopedic knowledge on this whole thing apparently. He didn't even mention the family stuff, so I thought that'd be news to him.
[speaker] Yeah, no, there's whole families. rotten. Although I haven't heard anything about the mother so maybe she didn't do anything terrible. I have no idea. for violent scheme. Real quick though. Was his plan actually to die? Like, did Alex Murdaugh hire cousin Eddie? Goofball, McGee. red-blooded patriot fucking wild maniac to come shoot him and kill him? That's wild. So his plan was actually to die. He said, come shoot me in the head. And then he survived. He's like, damn it. Time to change plan.
[speaker] Wow. Hey, a lot of things can be said about Alex Murdoch. but you know, god damn it, he gave it 110%. This man was ready to literally kill himself. So that way his son could still have some fucking cheated funds. Ten million dollar life insurance policy. The trials biggest bombshell was an unsent snapchat. Yes. This is the one that my dad was talking about Alex told police
[different_speaker] He had last seen his son and wife 90 minutes before he found their body. Several witnesses testified that they could hear Alex's voice in the background of the video. He got burned, this man. Oh Did the Snapchat influence Alex's decision? testify on his own but almost certainly
[speaker] The very first one. Well, yeah, and I think that is very clearly. his voice in the snapchat video. Very clearly.
[different_speaker] Alex did on the witness. Fess up. Alex admitted it was his voice on the video. you in fact kennel him on the night.
[speaker] So then he absolutely just admits to a lie right there. I do I do want to point out This man's got some wild hair coloration here. This looks like a weird slider. and a Dark Souls creator. He looks like a french fry with like some cheese sauce on the top. That shit is going hard.
[different_speaker] La-oh-ah-ruh-did-la- I'm so sorry that I did. Other than that about going to the kennel. I was very sure every aspect of this investigation. When Alex's brother Randy overheard- trying to bribe a nurse to let him use her phone. thought it was suspicious and brother Randy called the police. Oh, Jesus Christ. and
[speaker] Man, this guy just straight up looks evil. He looks actually soulless. Those are some hollow empty devil eyes right there. 100% sometimes People just look the part.
[different_speaker] but in an earlier interview with Investi- Alex had actually implicated his ground... He also told the jury that someone angry about the death of Mallory Beach committed the murder. These inconsistencies undermine Alex's Then there's the mess with Alex's financial. The prosecution argued that Alex's financial crimes couldn't be separated from the murder. because exposure.
[speaker] Vast financial crimes. Yeah, it speaks to his characters. Well, not only that, I imagine that also helps. to demonstrate, like make a character profile, right? I don't know if that is actually something that's usable in court. But doesn't that also serve to poke holes in the credibility since all of these financial crimes hinged on a bunch of lies and embezzlement and all of that. Or is that not allowed?
[different_speaker] every single one of them. You had to sit down and look someone in the eye and convince them that you were on their side when you were not. Wow, that's hardball. You asked me questions, but I can't. I can't remember sitting down with Deion. Alex's response. I did wrong and that I stole their money. What prosecutor Waters was getting at was Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Alex Murdock is sitting there and looking at you and Damn shouldn't believe. Look at how he lied in the past. That's strong as fuck!
[different_speaker] which was costing him as much as $60,000 a week. As for the weapons, prosecutors said casings for bullets. 300 blackout found near Maggie's body. and the Murdochs owned a rifle. chambered in 300 blackout and the weapon is now missing. Alex also couldn't account for the clothing he was wearing on the day of the murders. His clothes had never been found. his mother's caregiver testified that after the murder Alex tried to remind her about what he was wearing.
[speaker] I guess it's easy in hindsight, but I feel like even if I was in the court as this was unfolding the second it came to that point both of those in conjunction I'd be like well He fucking did it. Oh, what kind of coincidence is that? Oh, so they were killed with 300 blackout rounds. Oh, you have a weapon with 300 blackout. That's a weird coincidence. Can you bring it in so we can just make sure like everything's, you know, all good. Oh, it's missing. What happened to it? Oh, you don't know. Oh.
[speaker] Okay, what about your clothes? Can we... Like the clothes you were wearing on that night, maybe it picked up some forensic evidence from the real killers. Oh, you lost your clothes! Are you telling me a burglar came in the middle of the night while you were sleeping and took the fucking clothes off your back? Even your dirty goddamn undies, you took them? Oh, like what the fuck? This is so This is outrageous!
[different_speaker] the speed of the Druze just three hours of deliberation. Oh, nice. After a trial lasting a month and a half. That's a gold split. Yeah.
[speaker] Alex Murdoch was two consecutive life-sacrificers.
[different_speaker] for murdering his wife.
[speaker] When was the last time you heard something about Twitch that wasn't overwhelmingly negative? I can't even remember, it's been so long. Trying to remember a time where the Twitch- higher up seemed in touch with the community is like trying to remember a dream. Like, it's just extremely hard. how long it's been since Twitch was doing things that people generally liked. For years now, it's just been rolling out features that nobody in the world has
[speaker] ever asked for and that contribute nothing to the platform. Anyone remember? just a couple months back when they had their version of Super Chats? where they would take a paid message and then put it underneath the stream. where nobody in the world could see it. So you were actually just throwing money into the void, just floating. flushing it down your toilet basically. God rest the soul of elevated chat. I'm sure all three people who ever use that feature are still disappointed.
[speaker] distraught and mourning the loss of such an incredible monetization tool. Like it is so misguided. Another feature that they've rolled out that I'm sure. of you even knew existed is something called REACTS, where you as a viewer while watching a stream can react to it and all it does is you can send an emote at that very second you click react to let the streamer know what you thought of that moment that second.
[speaker] So that way when the streamer goes to their dashboard, they can click on the reacts and see like, oh, at minute 50. 55 of my stream, I had three pogs. That must have been a really good moment. Like it's fucking worthless features. It is nothing but horrible decisions from this company. They're making more bad choices than a college student who just took his first shot of fireball. But unlike the college student, Twitch isn't drunk.
[speaker] They're just stupid. I'm getting heated. Of course, not everyone at Twitch is this... Silly. Like not everyone's going wacko mode with these ideas. There are real people at Twitch that understand the platform. but they don't have the same power that the higher-ups do that are rolling out these awful decisions. Uh, why am I talking about this? Well, it's because they've just revealed two new awful decisions over the last 24 hours. Now one of them admittedly is not their fault. This comes with the layoffs.
[speaker] I will show you some clips from last night's stream where I really dive in deep on those. But the other one that not a lot of people have realized yet is they also made a statement on their sub-revenue split. You might remember, I also mentioned it recently in another video. Last year, towards the end of the year, Twitch announced that it would be getting rid of the 70-30 sub-revenue deal that they had with streamers.
[speaker] So now it would be 50-50 across the board. 70-30 would no longer exist, which means Twitch now offers the lowest amount of revenue to streamers. in the entire industry. They're now at the bottom of the food chain when it comes to sub-splits across the board of every streaming platform. and by a wide margin. YouTube is 70-30, I mean even Kik is like 90- 90-10 I think or even 95-5 I don't remember, but they offer the lowest split of subs.
[speaker] and it's not even close. And they really don't have any tools in place to try and make up for that, so... instead they double down on ads which is worse for everyone. Streamers don't like running ads. Viewers don't like watching ads, thus you're immediately killing the two people. that make streaming work, streamers and viewers. You are rolling out things that neither side wants. Their galaxy brain solution to the taking 20% away from the streamers is
[speaker] to force them to run more ads if they want to make up for that lost revenue. And streamers don't want to do that because that drives away their viewers. That's bad. Sometimes the viewers will come back, but when you run an ad on Twitch, you lose viewers. It's just how it works. No one wants to sit through fucking ten unskippable ads. So they'll go somewhere else. Maybe they come back, maybe they don't. And this is extremely detrimental because of pre-roll ads that play.
[speaker] when you click on a stream for the first time. This is the nail in the coffin for a lot of smaller streamers. where even if they're doing really cool content, a lot of people never find it, because when they click on that stream and they get fucking. two back-to-back 30-second ads, they just instantly leave and they'll never go back. So clearly it was a very constant... controversial decision one that a lot of people took issue with and now twitch is saying that
[speaker] We heard everything everyone was saying. It was a very loud conversation. and we laughed at all of you and we're spitting in your face. We made the right decision nerds. It's gonna be 50-50 forever. So they're patting each other on the back, slapping their ass, saying, Good game out there, team. They are taking their victory lap, letting us all know that 50-50 is here to stay forever. and then try and elaborate on why it's a good thing and how they're going to change their monetization model.
[speaker] in order to make Twitch the number one place to stream when it comes to revenue for streamers. And in the interview they said, we talk a lot about how we're in this together and part of that is innovation. We are committed to continuing to improve our monetization products and building new monetization products. products and at the end of the day we're committed to increasing the amount of money a streamer earns. Wow, such noble intentions with absolutely no way of delivering.
[speaker] One of the things Twitch is really going buck wild with is their ad incentive program. And here's what they had to say about that. Surprisingly, they did recognize that the intrusiveness of ads on Twitch is a big issue, one that they're trying to work on. They said the acceptance and engagement on the ad incentive program far exceeded our expectations so streamers are clearly seeing the value in running ads now.
[speaker] I like how they're saying that like a mark of pride. Streamers aren't happy about that, by the way. It's just that's their only option. In fact, if you go on Twitter and spend even just a couple of seconds type in the Twitch Ad Incentive Program, you'll see a lot of people outraged at it because a lot of the asks are huge for for the Ad Incident program up to like fucking seven minutes worth of ads. I've seen them, like for example, Kayla.
[speaker] Just Joel streams often. He's shown me his Ad Incentive program. Rex Gunderson, he's shown me his. Like the asks are not small and the pay they're offering isn't huge for smaller streamers. Even in the rare instance where a couple of larger streamers. posted their ad incentives where it was a lot of money for like fucking six or seven minutes of ads per hour. They still, most of them chose not to do it because of how intrusive
[speaker] all of the ads work to the viewers. It just makes the experience of watching their stream awful. having to be inundated with fucking seven minutes of ads per hour is a lot. when it comes to streaming. So a lot of them still just didn't choose to do it. The only reason there is any level of acceptance with the Ad Incentive program is because you have forced people to swallow this shit. Since there's now no longer a 70-30 deal or anything like that.
[speaker] The amount of sub revenue you can generate is significantly less. In fact, you'd probably make more money buying and reselling. eggs right now than you would trying to rely on sub money on Twitch. Now going forward Mint and acknowledge the state of ads on the platform isn't perfect yet and the company has taken steps to reduce their intrusiveness through static in-player ads and disabling pre-roll ads if creators display at least three minutes of ads per hour.
[speaker] We're really, really thinking about ad placement generally and ensuring that as a viewer, when you're looking for a new community that we're reducing the impact of ads. So they do recognize how it's very bad for small streamers when pre-rolls are playing. And right now their solution is we'll just play more ads during your stream and we'll get rid of pre-rolls. Like it's literally Ouroboros just constantly fucking feeding on ads and eating its own tail. Everything is all about.
[speaker] ads and it's still intrusive like it is still there like pre-rolls will exist unless you are running ads throughout your stream. So I still also don't understand why skippable ads aren't on the platform when those are pretty commonplace. Like I feel like skippable ads would at least help alleviate some of the headache there and make the ad breaks a little more palatable.
[speaker] But still, another thing that they mentioned is like all of their innovative tools they're working on to help creators monetize their content. They don't really shine a bright light on what all of those new innovations are looking like. Though I do imagine one of them they're talking about, because they do briefly mention like sponsorship opportunities through streaming on Twitch. And I think what they're talking about there is like something similar to the bounty board.
[speaker] Bounty board is something that's existed on Twitch for quite a few years now. Basically companies will. pay Twitch to have streamers of X amount of viewers stream their product for however many hours. and Twitch will give a portion of that money that the brand has paid to the streamer. I mean, in theory, like the concept is actually pretty solid, right? If Twitch is going to facilitate brand deals like that and just put it right on your dashboard, that's a pretty decent idea.
[speaker] But most people have woken up to the fact. that the deal is shit. Twitch is taking the lion's share of that brand deal and the streamer is getting very very little comparatively to what they would get if they just chased down the same deal themselves. or with like an agency or something. Like, if you're going to do a stream deal through Twitch, you're better off just clicking on the bounty board to see who's looking for streamers.
[speaker] and then reach out to the company yourself or have your manager or whatever agency you're reach out to them for you and let them know you're interested because you'll get a much better rate that way. Because Twitch has taken almost all of it. Like, I don't know many people that still use the bounty board because most people have realized this now. it is paying significantly less than had you just gotten the deal through any other means.
[speaker] So it's a decent idea in theory if Twitch wasn't taking so, so, so, so much of the brand deal. So I've been ranting about this for a while, but you can see there's a lot of problems that plague Twitter. which when it comes to streaming on there and trying to make a living off of it. Which is why so many streamers are choosing to stream elsewhere. YouTube or Kik. really are the two main competitors at the moment that people are switching to or starting with.
[speaker] And it's because you have a much better chance of making a living on those two platforms at the moment. Discoverability on Twitch used to be one of its strongest. benefits but currently twitch doesn't really have an edge in that category anymore either mainly because of what i mentioned earlier pre-rolls If you're towards the bottom and someone's willing to take a chance on your content, they click on it and they get a... pre-roll, they left. They're most likely not gonna stick around for that.
[speaker] Whereas if you started on YouTuber Kick, you just fire up your stream and your content's immediately accessible to anyone who might find it. So yeah, like you just stand a better chance of getting found elsewhere outside of Twitch at the moment, I would argue at least. So there's just, there's a lot of problems plaguing Twitch right now. They've made it very clear that they're not exactly turning.
[speaker] the profit they'd like to be turning and the decisions they're making to try and be more profitable are only hurting their platform even further. So let's talk about the layoffs now. Twitch laid off 400 employees yesterday. And what's crazy is the employees don't even know who got laid off yet. So the employees are still fucking trembling in fear wondering if they even have a job anymore. But this isn't a Twitch exclusive problem.
[speaker] I'm sure all of you know all of the big tech businesses, the tech industry as a whole. experienced a lot of bloat over the last few years because of COVID. They hired a lot of people. Now they're firing a lot of those people because... They don't need that many employees and they're not utilizing that many employees. Thus, they're making a lot of cuts. Amazon laid off like 9,000 people yesterday. So of course the 400 laid off at Twitch were a part of that.
[speaker] Yeah, we can talk about the Twitch stuff now. I see a lot of people. Coming after Twitch for the layoff, they laid off 400. staff members. I think it's very interesting. that Dan Clancy. The new CEO of Twitch is the one to make this announcement as opposed to like a parting gift from Emmet Shear, the previous CEO. that was kind of surprising Cause this is not really how you want to start your reign as the Twitch CEO with 400. Jobs taken away? but it's also not their fault Amazon laid off 9k.
[speaker] So people need to realize that. Since Twitch is part of Amazon, this is part of the overall Amazon layoffs. I don't think Twitch itself. was the one that kind of spearheaded it. Though I will say I think Twitch is a bloated company. I feel like losing 500 staff members isn't necessarily going to change too much about it. But I could be wrong. Maybe these are like really crucial members. But what's kind of fucked up about it is. Apparently, the Twitch staff don't even know who's been fired.
[speaker] sounds like huge corporate shit Yeah, that is kind of wild that the employees themselves don't know if they've been laid off or not yet. I feel like they probably should have. told them that they're fired before making the announcement. 400 employees fired out of 1200 is fucking rough. Is that how many Twitch has? Is it 1200? I don't know why, but I thought it was more... But yeah, I mean, it's not a small number by any means. But I do think Twitch was very bloated. I don't think you needed.
[speaker] that many employees to begin with. They're clearly not utilizing them to their full potential. Like I can count on one. the amount of features they've rolled out over the last couple years, right? Like they're clearly not being put to great use over there. But this wasn't like an explicit like this wasn't explicitly a twitch decision. This is. just the entire tech industry.
[speaker] I don't remember where the source was now, but there's a whole article written up about the collapse of the tech industry jobs right now. I believe they cited that because of COVID, all these companies panic hired a ton of people. because they thought they'd need significantly more employees to like run remote and all of that. So all of these companies really exploded with the amount of people on their payroll over COVID. and now that that's not going on anymore. They just have all of these.
[speaker] like this wild list of employees that they don't. use. They don't need any more. So now they're letting them all go all at once. So that's just this huge exodus. I just read something so ridiculous that I've been sitting here for the last like 10 or 15 minutes just stewing in my own filthy anger, almost in like this meditative state, just trying to process the absurdity of it. And this is a situation I'm not even involved in and yet still it has managed to steam my vegetables.
[speaker] just because of how outrageous it is. This whole thing is so crazy I just couldn't help myself but share it with you. with all of you, so I hope you don't mind if I hit the dance floor real quick and bust it wide open for you here. So two months ago, some of you may have seen that Afro Man posted this music video will you help me repair my door? This went viral on TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube as well and basically it's Afro Man making a song out of a raised
[speaker] that was conducted on his property based on narcotics and kidnapping claims. And it turns out... It was completely bogus. They got nothing out of it and they kind of ransacked this whole place and and he had cameras set up around his property that recorded all of it, so he made a music video kind of teasing them about it. He made a catchy little jingle about the whole thing and the title is about, you know, them
[speaker] breaking his door and breaking his gate and just going over the damage that they caused there while looking really silly. and now he is being sued for it. He is being sued because the officers were offended, their feelings got hurt and they're claiming a murder. emotional distress. He clowned on them and it hurt their god damn feeling so much that now they're coming after him legally. It wasn't enough to just destroy his property and pillage his whole
[speaker] like they were Vikings and also traumatized his kids apparently which is something he mentions in his song. Now they want to slap him even more by issuing this lawsuit to him. Which I think is just an absolute load of baloney. What a pile of dirty barnacles. Four deputies, two sergeants, and a- Detective with the Adams County Sheriff's Office brought the suit earlier this month claiming an invasion of privacy.
[speaker] Let me just stop you right there, Chief. An invasion of privacy, huh? You are on his private property. He has every right to record you. I'm not a lawyer, but would you also make this claim if you made yourself look fucking silly at a Starbucks who has security camera footage of you in their store like let's say you spilt coffee or you were pouring coffee down here
[speaker] your lieutenant's butthole giving him an enema in public and they're like, oh, this is kind of embarrassing. We're going to sue you for an invasion of privacy because you filmed us. with the argument work there in that place of business. I imagine private residents also. still have the right to record you when you are on their property. They don't need your consent. You entered their domain. You stepped into their neck of the woods. I feel like they have the right to record you. But again,
[speaker] I'm not a lawyer. I'm just a stupid paint-huffing idiot when it comes to the law, but I still just find the claim comical and invading. of privacy I guess them going through all of his shit throwing his suits all over the place breaking down his doors and all of that in his own home I guess that's not an invasion of privacy. That's just a general wrongful invasion, considering this whole thing was completely
[speaker] bogus. It was a completely botched little raid here. They're claiming that Afro-men used their faces from the raid and used in music videos and social media posts without their consent. Again, I don't think he needed that considering they're on his private property in the first place. place but regardless they go on saying it's it's caused them emotional distress embarrassment ridicule
[speaker] loss of reputation and humiliation. Ah, so these officers were born with glass bones and paper skin, huh? They can't take a few jokes on the internet. I imagine they're lying about this. I can't imagine they actually suffered any real emotional distress or anything. I don't think people were on the streets shooting spitballs at him as they walked by. by pointing and laughing. Though they should because they're fucking clowns for what they did here. I can't show the-
[speaker] music video but I highly recommend watching it. They look so fucking stupid in this thing. And it's all dogshit like none of it was real to begin with here it was just a completely failed raid from top to bottom and They even had the audacity to disconnect his cameras when they noticed that the security cameras were on. It's just foul, completely foul. I do hope they feel silly. But apparently, the silliness doesn't stop there. Maybe it's a humiliation.
[speaker] fetish because now they're suing him and making themselves look even stupider, which is crazy. I'll go ahead and boil all this down for you. The plaintiffs are seeking all of Afro Man's profits from the... of their personas that includes the proceeds from songs, music videos, and live event tickets. as well as any of the money that he made using their likeness in his brand and other merchandise and they're also looking for an injunction to take down the videos.
[speaker] Afro Man made like an entire albums worth of songs around this raid on his property and they all fucking bang. It is so amazing. Afroman absolutely crushed it with this whole thing. literally turned into like a money-making merchandise music video like all off of this failed raid from them and now they're coming to put their hand in his attempting to counter sue them for the undeniable damage this had on my client's family, career, and property.
[speaker] Law enforcement officers were acting on a warrant that stated probable cause existed that drugs and drug paraphernalia and that trafficking and kidnapping had taken place there, but it turned out that it was Turns out that boogie man was completely wrong, all of those suspicions turned out to be unfounded. and the raid failed to turn up any real criminal evidence, so charges were never filed. And in and I'll see you in the next one.
[speaker] have seized some of his money. He was talking about some missing money that took place during all of this and Whoa, can you believe it after a subsequent review by the State Bureau of Criminal Justice? investigations, they determined that the deputies had miscounted the amount seized during the raid itself. What a silly little error that was. What a goofy little freak accident that was. that some of the money was just a little miscounted and some of it went missing, I guess. Oh, that's odd.
[speaker] So that's really this whole situation they're suing because they looked fucking stupid here and a lot of people were making fun of them for this whole whole situation. Afroman put them on blast and made an entire album's worth of content around it. and now they're out for revenge. So I can't show you the music video, but I highly encourage you watch it. I would like to show you a couple of frames from it and just kind of talk about it.
[speaker] because it is so fucking wild. I'll go ahead and crop their faces out so they can't feel offended or humiliated. affiliated here. So this is one of the early shots. The officers were going around checking everything. every nook and cranny of his property. I guess for kidnapping victims, they're like pounds upon pounds of weed. And for some reason, Officer Action over here, fucking Danger Commander comes over and like looks behind the couch.
[speaker] is if he was gonna find like some kind of like goblin or something back there that he was gonna light up like I understand they thought that there was some kidnapping element to this whole thing. But I mean, even in this situation, if there was a kid back there and you climb over the back of the couch you're immediately pointing a gun in their face. I can't imagine that's the best way of looking for kidnapping victims.
[speaker] Like the way they go through his whole property is very cartoonish. Here's a little shot of some of the team out here for the class field trip. One of them is dressed like he's ready for actual combat, as if he was gonna get in here like a G.I. Joe episode and fucking hunt down Cobra Commander in this property. So the first thing they did when they arrived is they busted through this gate here and broke it. So after... from them showing up and then they go to his door
[speaker] and this is where you get the title of the song. They blast this shit in. This shit just gets rocketed off the frame here. So, you know, he's asking. Can you repair my door and my gate? That's the whole point of the song. bear this shit and then also pointing out all the other goofy things that happened. This is where Afro Man started to get a little suspicious about them potentially taking money from him so he starts talking about it in this scene right here
[speaker] This was already after going through and throwing around half of his belongings and like going through each and every suit pocket they could find. And here's the final final shot this is where the fun comes to an end they disconnect his camera So they open up this panel on the wall and and they disconnect all the shit. So He could no longer record the rest of what was going on on the property. I just really had to talk about it because it got me fuming. To turn around and sue...
[speaker] someone for hurt feelings after you were just in the wrong to begin with? Is this such a level of delusion that I can't help but be upset about? Afro Man did nothing wrong. He recorded you guys and then took a bad situation that you have created. The claims you were there investigating, nothing was ever found, so it all seems like bullshit. and he took that and he made Comedy out of it. He made content out of it.
[speaker] to try and turn something shitty into something less shitty and now he's being punished for it or at least attempting to. from these extremely sensitive, I guess, officers that are super offended that people have been making fun of them for this. Like, it's pretty disgusting. So yeah, I just wanted to at least put this out there because it was something that I felt very strongly about. That's really about it. See ya.
[speaker] A few months ago I watched what had to be one of the wildest encounters I've ever seen. This is a... vigilante predator hunter group that was busting the person they were investigating in public. And this goes completely in Sano's style. This is... It becomes cartoonish. It's almost like a Benny Hill chase scene here. I couldn't believe what was unfolding in front of me.
[different_speaker] I'm gonna be looking for my fiber. Your what? Fiber. Fiber? Yeah. cuz I gotta poop. You gotta poop? I'm constipated. Acting constipated. Yeah?
[speaker] This is a very interesting tactic. This is a high level maneuver. He is claiming that he's not there at the meat spot for a 13 year old boy, he's there to get some fiber so he can take a shit. He's been constipated so he's there for some poop pills. And it doesn't take some galaxy brain genius to put together the puzzle pieces here, connect the dots and deduce that he is on meth. You know, he's getting loopy off that poopy right now. He is high on meth.
[speaker] Which isn't just speculation, at the end of the video they release their entire investigation. screen shots of all the text messages that were exchanged between this guy and who he thought was a 13 year old and meth comes up a lot even right before meeting meth was discussed And as you can see in the title, he was arrested and they did pretty much confirm meth was in his system.
[different_speaker] Hey man, I can involve the police or we can have a conversation. You want to have a conversation? You want to turn around and talk to me? Hey, bro, I can call the cops right now or we can just I'm actually really constipated. We can just have a conversation. I'm actually really constipated, sir. Please, can you actually let me get... get my supplements so I c
[speaker] One should have been involving the authorities the second you found a real pedophile that was trying to meet up for sex with a third... 13 year old and like get them smoking meth or whatever. Like I don't understand why that wasn't the first thing you did. Luckily, there's spoilers in the title, so you know he does get arrested, but... not for the reasons of this investigation. Some crazy shit happens towards the end.
[speaker] had he involved law enforcement earlier, even from the start, I feel like this could have been far more effective. It seems like the first thing he did when he identified a real pedophile was try and figure out. out how to monetize it and make a viral video out of it or something because he gets like like two different cameras out he's got like the fucking steady cam he's got So many cameras set up. He's got like the GTA cinematic angle going on here
[speaker] So it really feels like the number one concern was trying to figure out a way to monetize it. He also has like calls to action in the video to subscribe. subscribe to his channel. He's got the people verse pred watermark. This shit is branded out of the wazoo. So it does really feel like the number one thing he was looking for here was a way of making money off of the bust, which is is kind of weird. It is still good that this does lead to an arrest but I really do wish it was handled with
[speaker] collaboration from the actual authorities.
[different_speaker] Can you help me find? Fiber pills. Can you help me find fiber pills for me? Why would you want to call the cops for me when I'm trying to- I know why you're here. Why am I here? To meet my 13 year old little brother. Who is that? I don't know who that is. Who is that? I have no clue!
[speaker] Christ, where are they hiding the fiber pills in this bitch? Like, goodness gracious, are they underground? This man's out here trying to locate fiber pills and it's like trying to find pirates buried treasure apparently. But anyway, you can see he's really starting to tweak quite a bit now. Things are getting escalated. the man filming is threatening to call the cops, which is something I feel he should have done quite a long time ago. but we're only just beginning.
[different_speaker] Hey buddy, is this you? Hey, please, let me. Why do I have a picture of you? Why are you doing this to me? Is this you? Why do I have a picture of you? What's this? What is it? Why do I have a picture of you? Oh my God, that's disgusting! a picture? Why do I have a picture of your? This guy's here to meet a third
[speaker] 13 year old boy for s*** and a given crystal meth! Oh my god! Negotiations. crumbled, diplomacy falls and then things really pop the fuck off. So he shows him that he has a picture of this guy's asshole. and then we enter like the DPS check of the raid boss encounter here. So now he's chasing the pedophile around while shouting he's here to meet a 13 year old. year old boy for sex the predators start shouting everyone in the shopping center is confused
[speaker] and maybe even a little frightened from this sudden explosion of yelling and all of that. and we also get close ups of the meth molesters head and it seems like he has a lot of of dandruff not that that has anything to do with anything at all it just struck me as wow That's a lot of dandruff. So he might want to pick up a bottle of Head and Shoulders on his way back to the poopy pill aisle.
[different_speaker] This guy right here is here to meet a 13 year old boy and to give him crystal meth. Okay, what's happening? I'm trying to find you. Do you know where the fiber pills are? Call the cops.
[speaker] This guy's here to meet a 13 year old boy for don't touch me sir. Don't touch me. Why stop?
[different_speaker] Don't touch me and don't put your hands in front of my camera, bro. Who the f*** are you? Stop!
[speaker] The cameraman here is really coming across like a combative action. asshole. Obviously the store employee doesn't know the situation. He's not fucking omniscient. All he sees is two people screaming. in his store while one of them has multiple cameras set up Like he's out here trying to film a 360 degree music video. So he's just trying to get in the middle of this and like, hey, Can you deescalate it? You know, take it anywhere else. And for some reason, the predator busts.
[speaker] the scripture, is now starting to get mad at this guy who's just doing his fucking job. Like he's done nothing. wrong. He doesn't know what's happening here, he's just trying to de-escalate the situation.
[different_speaker] This guy's here to meet a 13 year old boy first. Get in front of my camera again, bro. Because you're not. Get in front of my camera again. You don't have permission to. film your camera. Who are you? Who are you? You need to leave. Hey buddy, get the f**k out of my way. Get the f**k out of my way. Sir, you gotta leave my store. No I don't. Call the cops.
[speaker] This guy seems like he was closer to fighting the store employee just doing his job. than he was to fighting the actual pedophile that he was there to bust. This shit is crazy. Why is this happening? Why are you here to meet a 13 year old boy? Why would I do such a thing? Then leave.
[different_speaker] Go home. Hey, you let me find my fiber pills. Oh, your fiber pills? Where's the fiber? Oh
[speaker] Just when you thought it was starting to wrap itself up This fucking guy goes back. looking for fiber pills. he goes back to the fucking fiber pill aisle and keeps the whole song and dance going. We're in Act Two now. It is- incomprehensible the shit that is unfolding here. I can't believe that this actually is a real thing that happened and isn't some like staged scripted fucking piece of I don't know, fiction. It's unbelievable.
[different_speaker] Why are you here to meet a 13 year old boy? Why are you here to harass me? Why are you here to meet a 13 year old boy? Are you trying to prevent? No, I'm just talking. 2235. I'm a weirdo? Why do I have a picture of his asshole if I'm a weirdo?
[speaker] Why do I have a picture of his face? Look at it. Why do I have a picture of his face if I'm the weirdo? Some of the other people around him start calling him a weirdo, the guy filming. to which he takes great offense. So he goes over to the proof that he's not weird. So he goes and says, if I'm a weirdo, why do I have a picture of his asshole? Checkmate. Regular old Saul Goodman over here defending himself.
[speaker] I can't be weird, I have a picture of his butt hole right here, look at this. He takes his phone around like it's Show and tell, he passes it around saying, Hey look, I'm not weird, look, this is his anus. I don't know what the strategy is there. He could have easily explained, I'm conducting an investigation. This guy. I was trying to meet up with my 13 year old brother. That's a lot more easy to understand than like, hey I'm not weird, this is this size ass.
[speaker] Like I don't I don't know what the thought process was. I think he was so lost and deep in fight mode that he. was just trying to like get aggressive with everybody, even just completely innocent people that didn't understand what was happening.
[different_speaker] Trying to meet up with little kids. Oh
[speaker] I saw a comment that perfectly described how this part in the parking lot plays out. They said he's acting like he's the 13 year old boy running away from a pedophile. And that is so accurate, he's running around like... hysterically screaming and just going absolutely ballistic. runs in a circle and then even lays on the ground for a little bit, kind of wiggling around.
[different_speaker] Did I just go poop? AHHHHH! Oh my god it gets even better!
[speaker] The pedophile is high on meth and operating a vehicle and it goes about as you'd expect. He immediately peels out. and fucking blast himself like right over like a small little tree in some bushes. It really looked like it was about to take flight. That was some shit out of Need for Speed, honestly. Like, god damn.
[different_speaker] Oh my god! Whoa, hit and run, call the police!
[speaker] Call the police! Immediately after vaporizing a tree and destroying that area of bushes... he peels out once again and manages to hit one of only two potential obstacles in the entire fucking parking lot. someone else's car. He goes by and hits someone else's car. There is literally only two cars in this entire fucking parking lot. It is actually more impressive that he managed to hit something. Like I can't even, I don't even fathom. how he could have fucked up even worse. It's unbelievable.
[different_speaker] Just call the police guys, I got the tags, call the police! Call the police! Call the police!
[speaker] Call the cops, bro, I got the video. You don't need the video, just call the cops. I always hate that fucking mentality. Hey someone else call the police. I'm busy recording No no no no no, I'm recording so someone else call the police to handle this. There's only a handful of situations where that makes any sense. And that's when there's already a lot. group there, then having a video of the situation can be helpful to the
[speaker] overall thing. So you could have one person video while someone else is calling the authorities. But in this case, it was just him for the entire thing right up until the very end. He should have been the one to call the police, but didn't. And the predator. makes another inexplicable decision. Instead of leaving, he instead pulls up to the front of the store, he just ran away screaming and parks it. He just drops that shit right in front of the store he just left.
[speaker] and then gets out to try and run back into the store, which I don't understand at all. He's treating it like this was some kind of safe zone or something. And as he gets out of the car and tries to run back in the store, he gets tackled by a good samaritan who had just seen the hit and run. the, and everything that unfolded in the parking lot. So he gets tackled by that guy and it's like a Goldberg spear. That is a great form textbook tackle. and then the cops do show up to arrest him.
[different_speaker] Yeah, that's the one.
[speaker] The cops go through his things, they find a pipe, they find a lot of stuff, they arrest him for the driving DUI. They don't seem super interested in the predator catchers investigate. and what he's talking about, they don't really pay too much attention to that. Instead, they arrest him for, of course, the way he was driving the vehicle. Now, I've mentioned this numerous times over the years, I'm not really a fan of vigilante predator hunting.
[speaker] For the simple reason that 9 times out of 10 the pedophiles that get caught in these operations don't face any real repercussions. percussions other than like a video being made about them. But law enforcement can't use the investigations because they're less than professional. Meaning the predator doesn't spend any time in the slammer, they don't go to jail, which allows them to continue preying on children in their communities. Now, I do think there are extenuating circumstances, like for example, EDP.
[speaker] EDP may have not gone to jail, but that video that was made about him by the fucking Gotham Knights of Predator Catchers did a great service to the whole community because it exposed him for abusing his platform, trying to meet up with children, and even if he did... go to jail it still took away his access to more potential victims so overall it was a positive thing though ideal outcome would have been him also going to jail. In this case, the video we just watched,
[speaker] This predator probably would have never went to jail had he not operated the vehicle while he was alive. while high on meth and caused a massive commotion there and hitting multiple things. Had he not been driving that recklessly and high... He probably would have never seen any jail time for the investigation conducted by this channel. So it's just one of those things where... Yes, it is good to expose the predators, but I really wish it was handled in collaboration with law enforcement. So that way.
[speaker] not only would they be exposed publicly, they would also face the jail time associated with the crime. But yeah, anyway, this video was wild and I just kind of wanted to talk about it a little bit today. That's about it. See ya.
